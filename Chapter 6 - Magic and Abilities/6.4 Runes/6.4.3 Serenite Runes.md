Serenite runes are designed for **fast, combat-ready rune work**, primarily through **armor inscriptions** and **fixed 3-rune sets**. Serenite does not use Carbon stabilizers.
### Serenite Rune Counts
Serenite inscriptions follow strict size rules:
- You may inscribe and use **exactly 1 rune**, or **exactly 3 runes** as a set.
- You may never use **2 runes**, and you may never use **more than 3**.

A 3-rune set is commonly called a **Serenite triangle** (a fixed group of three runes).
### Activation and Mana Cost
Serenite effects are activated by supplying mana.
- **Mana cost:** **5 mana per rune**
    - **1 rune:** 5 mana
    - **3 runes (triangle):** 15 mana
- **Activation timing:**
    - Activating a **Serenite triangle** requires **one action**.
    - Activating a **single Serenite rune** requires a **bonus action**.
    - Activation is done at a range of 5 ft within sight, each Serenite schooling level that goes up by 5 ft. 
### Serenite School Scaling
A Serenite Runemaster learns runes and gains flat casting bonuses as they advance.
- You learn **1 Serenite rune per Serenite School Level**, up to **School Level 6**.
- At **School Level 6**, you gain **+3 to all Serenite castings**.
- At **Runemaster level 19**, you gain an additional **+3 to all castings**.
- At **Runemaster level 20**, you gain an additional **+3 to all castings**.
