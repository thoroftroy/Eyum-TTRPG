Runes are a form of magic created by inscribing specific symbols into a surface. A rune has a defined function, and multiple runes can be combined to create more complex effects.
### Runic Schools
Runes are divided into three schoolings:
- **Xeran**: Uses **runic circles** with **5 or more runes** to create scalable effects.
- **Serenite**: Uses **exactly 3 runes** (a “triangle”/set of three). It is less flexible, but more efficient and combat-ready.
- **Vindroth**: Uses **written sentence structures** (“paragraphs”) to create conditional, programmed rune effects.
### Runemaster Schooling Progression
At **Runemaster level 1**, you must choose **one** schooling: **Xeran**, **Serenite**, or **Vindroth**.
- You **cannot** use runes from a schooling you have not learned.
- You may not learn an additional schooling until you have taken **6 levels** in each schooling you already know.
- Many rune features reference **School Level** (your level in that specific schooling), not your total Runemaster level.
- After you have completed **all three schoolings to 6** (total **18 Runemaster levels**), features that reference “level requirement” may instead use your **total Runemaster level**.
#### Runemaster Level Beyond 20 (Multiclass Scaling)
After **Runemaster level 20**, you may increase your effective “Runemaster Level” for rune castings by adding **half of your levels in other magical classes** (rounded down).  
Example: Runemaster 20 + Wizard 10 counts as **Runemaster 25** for rune castings.
### Affinity
All runes use your affinity for their attack rolls and spell save dc (10 + affinity). If you have less than 1 in the related affinity you cannot learn a rune. 
## Crafting Runes
Runes must be **inscribed** into a material before they can be used.
### Requirements
To inscribe a rune, you must have:
- An **Inscription Kit**
- At least **1 level in Runemaster**
- Knowledge of the specific rune being inscribed
- The required time (based on the material)
### Rune Knowledge Limits
- A Runemaster can know **1 rune per Runemaster level** (the Xeran rune Carbon does not count and is free but requires one Xeran Schooling Level).
- You may change which runes you know every **2 Runemaster levels**.
- You may only have 1 runic circle active per Runemaster level, attempting to create another one will destroy the runes on the oldest circle. 
### Crafting Rules
- **Durability**: The number of castings the inscription can withstand before the rune becomes unusable.
- **Modifier**: Applied to rolls made using the rune inscribed on that material (when a roll is required) or added to flat bonuses.
- If you attempt to craft during combat, inscription takes **one full action**.
- If inscription is **interrupted for any reason**, the attempt **fails**.

To destroy a inscription use a void rune or simply break the material. To remove Skin runes you may simply release your magic on them and they will fade after 5 turns.
