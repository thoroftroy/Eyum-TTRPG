Vindroth runes are written as **sentence structures** (often called _paragraphs_), allowing rune magic to function like a **programmed trigger system**: _when a condition is met, an effect occurs_.

Vindroth runes are not arranged in circles. Instead, they are inscribed as ordered “words” that form a readable sequence (ex: **If … Than … Else …**).
### Inscription Rules
- Each Vindroth rune occupies **1 square inch** of space.
- All runes in a paragraph must be inscribed into **one continuous piece of material**.
- If the material has a complete break that separates words, the paragraph **loses the separated words**. This may weaken, change, or fully disable the effect.
### Vindroth Structure Limits
A Vindroth paragraph is limited by your **Vindroth School Level**.
- You may include **1 “If … Than” block per Vindroth School Level**.
- Each Vindroth School Level also increases how many logic-connectors you may include (Else / And / Or / Not).
- At **level 19**, the maximum increases from **6 to 7** and at **20** it raises again to 8. From this point every 2 levels of effective Runemaster Level raises the maximum by 1. 
### Rune Knowledge
- If and Than runes are always known and do not count against total runes known. 
### Using Xeran as Effect Payloads
Vindroth can call Xeran runes as **effect payloads** (usually to define damage type / element / output).
Example structure:
- **If** object (human) **entered** size (5) shape (sphere) **Than** Power (Xeran Fire)
To increase output, you may repeat effect runes:
- … **Than** Power (Xeran Fire) **And** Power (Xeran Fire)
With each And Power adding another damage as well as consuming 1 Structure Limit
## Vindroth Conditionals

| Rune          | Effect                                                                                                       |
