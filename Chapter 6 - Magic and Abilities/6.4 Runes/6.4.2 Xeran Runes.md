Xeran runes are primarily used in **runic circles** or **embedded into objects**. Most Xeran runes have little or no effect on their own; the intended use is combining multiple runes into a circle to create a scalable effect.
### Learning Xeran
To cast a Xeran runic circle, you must know:
- **Carbon**, and at least **one** other Xeran rune.
- You may not learn an elemental rune in an affinity which you do not have more than 0 in
### Xeran Runic Circles
A **Xeran runic circle** is a single circle of runes inscribed into one material. Circles are typically activated by supplying them with **mana**.
**Rules**
- Xeran circles use **5 or more runes**.
- Xeran circles normally cannot exceed **19 total runes** (**10 non-carbon** runes + **9 Carbon** runes).
- Xeran circles can be activated **once per turn** as an action with a range of touch.
	- The range of activation goes up by 5 ft per Schooling Level
- A circle can be activated a number of times equal to the **Durability** of the material before the inscription becomes unusable.
- **Mixing materials** within the same circle causes the circle to **fail**.
### Carbon Requirement
A Xeran circle must include Carbon runes as stabilizers.
- In a circle, the number of **Carbon** runes must equal:  
    **(Number of non-carbon runes) - 1**  
    (Ignore _Link_ runes for this requirement.)
### Mana Cost and Level Requirements
Mana costs increase exponentially as the number of non-carbon runes increases.

|# of non-carbon runes|Circle size (runes)|Mana Requirement|Level Requirement|
|---|---|---|---|
|3|5 (3 regular, 2 Carbon)|5|1 (School Level)|
|4|7 (4 regular, 3 Carbon)|10|2|
|5|9|20|3|
|6|11|40|4|
|7|13|80|6|
|8|15|160|18 (Runemaster Level)|
|9|17|320|19|
|10|19|640|20|
## Xeran Rune Tables
#### Utility Runes
Utility runes are used to control activation, linking, targeting logic, timing, and direction.

| Rune     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                | Effect (Weapon) | Effect (Armor) |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Carbon   | **Required stabilizer.** In a runic circle, the number of Carbon runes must equal the number of other runes (ignoring Links) **minus 1**.                                                                  | None            | +1 AC          |
| Time     | Acts as a timer. You may load the Time rune with mana; every minute it loses 1 stored mana. A Detect rune can be used to trigger when the timer reaches a specific value or runs out.                      | +3 to Hit       | +2 AC          |
| Detect   | Detects a specified thing. Use a Link rune and a rune outside the circle to define what is being detected. Can be used with other circles to detect complex conditions.                                    | None            | None           |
| Kinetic  | Applies motion/force. Must be given a direction; if left without a direction, the energy releases outward in all directions and the circle’s effectiveness is reduced by half.                             | +2 to Hit       | +1 AC          |
| Creation | Creates a specified element when linked with that element. Can be linked to a circle to produce more complex items. Must be supplied with adequate mana to function (1 mana per gram of material created). | None            | Unbreakable    |
| Link     | Links runes/circles to allow more complex structures and external references. This allows multiple materials to be used in one casting across multiple circles.                                            | None            | None           |

| Down     | Linked activation is directed downward.                                                                                                                                                                    | None            | None           |
| North    | Linked activation is directed north.                                                                                                                                                                       | None            | None           |

| South    | Linked activation is directed south.                                                                                                                                                                       | None            | None           |
| West     | Linked activation is directed west.                                                                                                                                                                        | None            | None           |
| Out      | Linked activation applies in all directions outward (excluding things inside the circle).                                                                                                                  | None            | None           |
| In       | Linked activation applies inward, only affecting things inside the circle.                                                                                                                                 | None            | None           |
#### Elemental Runes
Elemental runes provide elemental effects. When mixed in a circle, their damage types combine and their damage stacks. The damage type of the runic circle will be the combined damage type from [[2.6 Damage Types and Resistances]], if no compatible damage type exists multiple damage types may be used for a single casting. 

**Opposites:** Opposite elements cannot be used together without negating each other on a 1-for-1 basis.  
Example: 2 Fire + 1 Water = 1 Fire.

**Infernal Exception:** Infernal runes allow opposites to combine into their combined damage types instead of negating (see Infernal in Special Runes).

| Rune     | Affinity | Description                              | Effect (Weapon)      | Effect (Armor)                              |

### Special Runes
Special runes have unique effects and are typically used to alter, bypass, or destroy rune structures. Note that generic affinity modifiers apply to all rolls, if generic is specified it is applied twice. 

| Rune       | Affinity                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Effect (Weapon)      | Effect (Armor)                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Chaos      | Generic + Air                | Randomizes the circle’s damage type between the elemental runes. Roll 1d8 and count down the elemental rune table.                                                                                                                                                                                             | +1d12 Random Damage  | If roll is <4 gain +2 AC, otherwise lose -2 AC |
| Void       | Generic + Water + Air        | Counters rune circles by destroying them while the Void rune remains inside. If the circle contains more than 4 non-carbon runes, additional Void runes are required: **1 Void per additional 4 non-carbon runes**. (This rune is not inscribed into the material of the circle, it is separate and placed on) | +2d8 True Damage     | -1 to all non-magical damage taken             |
| Cursed     | Generic + Fire               | Reverses a spell’s damage type (example: Water becomes Fire).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | +1d8 Cursed Damage   | Resistance to cursed damage                    |
| Infernal   | Generic  + Fire + Earth      | Allows opposite rune types to be stacked without negation, converting them into their combined damage types. One Infernal rune supports up to **4 other runes** before requiring an additional Infernal rune (**1 per 4**).                                                                                    | +1d8 Infernal Damage | -1 to all magical damage taken                 |
| Corruption | Generic + Fire + Earth + Air | After activation completes, the circle destroys all runes in the circle, leaving nothing remaining.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | +1 Corruption Damage | Immunity to Corrupt condition                  |
