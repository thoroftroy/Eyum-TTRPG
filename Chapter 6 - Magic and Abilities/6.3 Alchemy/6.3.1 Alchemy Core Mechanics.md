##### Alchemical Core Mechanics

- Formula Preparation: You can prepare 3 formulas per long rest, +1 per level.
    
- Concoction Use: All concoctions are one-use. Once thrown or drunk, they must be remade.
    
- Experimental Mixtures: Combine concoctions mid-combat (Action, DC = 10 + # of effects combined).
    
- Alchemical Efficiency (Passive): You may reuse a Stabilizer or Catalyst for free once per long rest.
    
- Transmutation Bench (Optional Crafting Upgrade): Unlocks at Level 5; allows combining rare reagents into synthetic versions of others.
