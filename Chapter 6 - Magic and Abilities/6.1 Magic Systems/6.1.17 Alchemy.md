Alchemy in Eyum is not a form of spellcasting but rather an advanced craft that harnesses chemical and elemental reactions to produce potions, powders, gels, and other alchemical concoctions. The effectiveness of an alchemical mixture depends on the caster’s Affinity with the elements involved in its creation.

##### Creating an Alchemical Mixture

An alchemical mixture is made using base ingredients, catalysts, and stabilizers. Each ingredient type contributes to the final effect of the potion or compound.

1. Base Ingredients - Determine the core effect of the potion.
    

- Fire-based ingredients create combustibles and explosives.
    
- Water-based ingredients focus on healing and purification.
    
- Air-based ingredients enhance mobility or produce vapor-based effects.
    
- Earth-based ingredients increase durability and toughness.
    

3. Catalysts - Enhance or modify the Effect.
    

- Common catalysts include magical herbs, distilled minerals, and infused essences.
    

5. Stabilizers - Ensure the potion remains safe and doesn’t degrade or explode.
    

- Without stabilizers, unstable potions may have unintended side effects.
