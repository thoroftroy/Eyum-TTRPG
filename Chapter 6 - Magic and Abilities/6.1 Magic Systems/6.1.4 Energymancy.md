Energymancy is the manipulation of **energy flow**, not the casting of spells. Energyweavers do not prepare or learn spells; instead, they perform **Energymancy Actions** that move, convert, store, or overload energy.

Energymancy obeys conservation. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only relocated or transformed.
## Energy Types
Energymancy primarily interacts with three internal energy pools:
- **Hit Points (HP):** The force of life and survival.
- **Vitality:** Physical and biological energy.
- **Mana:** Magical and arcane energy.
## Energy Conversion
Energyweavers may freely convert between these energies using the following ratios. These conversions work in either direction.

- **3 Mana ⇄ 1 Vitality**
- **3 Vitality ⇄ 1 Hit Point**

Conversions may target the Energyweaver or another creature if an Energymancy Action or subclass feature allows it.
#### Excess Energy Rule
Mana, Vitality, and HP can **never exceed their maximum values**.
When an Energymancy effect would cause Mana, Vitality to exceed its maximum:
1. Total the excess Mana or Vitality.
2. Divide the excess by **3**, rounding up.
3. The result is taken as **true damage directly to HP**.

This rule applies to the Energyweaver or to other creatures and can be intentionally used to **overload a target** to deal damage.
## Energymancy Actions
Energymancy actions are not spells. Each action describes a **method of moving or manipulating energy**. Numerical scaling is handled through class features, affinities, or subclasses.

Unless stated otherwise, all Energymancy actions require **1 Action**.
#### Convert Energy
_Learned at Energyweaver Level 1_
Convert one energy type you possess into another using standard Energymancy ratios.
- You may convert any amount of energy.
- You may only target yourself.
- HP cannot be converted using this action.
#### Transfer Energy
_Learned at Energyweaver Level 2_
Transfer Mana or Vitality between yourself and a **willing** creature you are touching.
- A creature cannot be reduced below **0 Vitality**.
- Energy cannot be converted during the transfer, any conversion must be performed afterward as a separate action.
#### Drain Energy
_Learned at Energyweaver Level 3_
Extract Mana or Vitality from a creature within range.
- Target makes a **CON save**.
- On failure, **10%** of the target’s total Mana or Vitality (chosen by the caster) is transferred to you.
- The drained energy is placed directly into the corresponding pool and cannot be converted during this step.
- If a creature has no Mana or Vitality remaining, you may begin draining **HP** instead.
#### Inject Energy
_Learned at Energyweaver Level 5_
Force Mana or Vitality into a creature.
- If the target is willing, they gain the energy normally.
- If the target is unwilling, they make a **CON save**:
    - On failure, they gain the energy.
    - On success, **25%** of the intended energy is consumed, and the remainder is treated as excess energy on the caster, dealing true damage to them following excess energy rule.
#### Release Stored Energy
_Learned at Energyweaver Level 7_
Release stored energy in a violent burst around yourself, converting it into raw force.
- Choose Mana or Vitality to consume.
- Every **3 Mana or 1 Vitality** spent deals **+1d6 force damage** to all creatures in a **10 ft radius**.
- Every **10 Vitality or 30 Mana** spent increases the radius by **10 ft**.
#### Equalize Energy
_Learned at Energyweaver Level 10_
Redistribute energy evenly among a group of creatures.
- Choose **Mana or Vitality**.
- Choose any number of targets:
    - Willing targets are affected automatically.
    - Unwilling targets may resist with a **CON save**.
- Maximum number of targets = **Energyweaver level / 3**.
- Total all chosen energy from all targets, then redistribute it evenly.
- This action does **not** trigger the excess energy rule.
- Any remaining excess energy is assigned to creatures with higher maximums at the Energyweaver’s discretion.
#### Sever Energy
_Learned at Energyweaver Level 15_
Sever the flow of a chosen energy type within a creature you can see.
- Choose **Mana** or **Vitality**
- Target makes a **CON save**
- On failure:
    - The chosen energy type is **locked at its current value** for 1 minute
    - The target cannot gain or lose that energy type by any means
- On success:
    - The target cannot gain the chosen energy type until the end of its next turn
- This does not suppress existing effects, only energy gain/loss
- HP cannot be targeted by this action until level 20. 
- This action may only be used 3 times per short rest. 
#### Collapse Energy
_Learned at Energyweaver Level 20_
Force all unstable energy in a target to catastrophically resolve.
- Choose a creature you can see
- Total the target’s **current Mana and Vitality**
- The target makes a **CON save**
- On failure:
    - All Mana and Vitality are reduced to **0**
    - The total removed energy is treated as excess energy and converted into **true HP damage** on the target
- On success:
    - Half of Mana and Vitality are removed instead (rounded down)
    - Only removed energy is converted to damage
## Subclass Specific Actions
#### Transfer Life
_Requires Life Subclass_  
_Learned at Energyweaver Level 3_
Move HP between two living creatures you can touch.
- You may be one of the targets.
- Conversion between Vitality and HP is allowed at a **1:1 ratio**.

_Learned at Energyweaver Level 5_
Drain HP from a living creature.

#### Transfer Heat
_Requires Heat Subclass_  
_Learned at Energyweaver Level 3_
Extract thermal energy from one source and deposit it elsewhere.
