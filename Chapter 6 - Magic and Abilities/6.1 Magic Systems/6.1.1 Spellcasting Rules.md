Spells in Eyum require two primary components: Mana and Affinity.

- Mana represents the energy expenditure required to cast a spell.
    
- Affinity determines the strength and effectiveness of the spell.
    

Some spells use Vitality or Health instead of Mana as an energy source, these are explicitly stated in the spell description.
