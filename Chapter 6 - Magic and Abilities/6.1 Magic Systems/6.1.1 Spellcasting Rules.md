Spells in Eyum require two primary components: Mana and Affinity.
- Mana represents the energy expenditure required to cast a spell.
- Affinity determines the strength and effectiveness of the spell.

Some spells use Vitality or Health instead of Mana as an energy source, these are explicitly stated in the spell description.
### Casting a Spell
When casting a spell, the caster applies their Affinity Modifier based on the spell’s element:
- Single-Affinity Spells: Use the caster’s Elemental Affinity (e.g., Fire) plus the Generic Affinity 
- Dual-Affinity Spells: Add together all applicable Affinity types for the final effect.
- Necrotic and Radiant Spells: Use Generic Affinity, as they do not belong to a specific elemental group. This also applies to any other element that is not listed.

Affinity scaling:
- In early levels, Generic Affinity spells tend to be more powerful, as negative modifiers in other Affinity types weaken their respective spells.
- In later levels, specialized Affinities become much stronger due to their stacking potential.
### Accuracy
Spell Attack Bonus = Spellcasting Modifier (from class) + Total Affinity Modifier (related to the spell)

When casting a spell that requires an attack roll, the caster rolls 1d20 + their total Affinity Modifier + their Spellcasting Modifier (based on class). The result is compared to the target’s Armor Class (AC). If the result is equal to or greater than the target’s AC, the spell hits.

Each spellcaster class uses a specific Spellcasting Modifier:
- Wizard, Energyweaver- Intelligence
- Cleric, Druid, Runemaster, Ranger - Wisdom
- Warlock, Sorcerer, Bard, Paladin - Charisma
- Others (Fighter, Rogue, etc.) - Will rarely use spells but use their Wisdom Modifier as the default.
	- Generally speaking the physical classes can only cast spells if you multiclass with a magical class, in that case you would use that class's spellcasting modifier for your spells.

When multiclassing you can choose which modifier to use based on which class you have the most levels in, if the classes are tied then you get to choose. 

The Affinity Modifier is determined by the spell’s elemental components. You always add:
- The Affinity linked to the spell's element (e.g., Fire Affinity for a fire spell)
- Your Generic Affinity (which applies to all spells)

Example:  
A Wizard casting a Fire spell has:
- Intelligence Modifier: +3
- Fire Affinity: -2
- Generic Affinity: +1  
    Their total bonus is (+3 - 2 + 1) = +2.  
    They roll a d20 and add +2 to determine if the spell hits the target’s AC.
### Concentration
Some spells require a caster to maintain their focus over multiple turns. These are known as Concentration Spells. Maintaining concentration on such spells can be disrupted by distractions or attacks, requiring the caster to succeed on regular concentration saves.

Concentration Mechanics:
- Concentration Check:  
    At the start of each of the caster’s turns while maintaining a concentration spell, they must succeed on a Concentration Save or the spell immediately ends.
- Concentration Save DC: 15
- Calculating Concentration Saves: Roll 1d20 + Affinity Modifier of the spell being concentrated on.
- Concentration and Damage: Whenever the caster takes damage while concentrating, they must immediately make an additional concentration save (DC 15). If the caster fails this save, concentration is broken, and the spell ends immediately.
- If you cast another spell that requires concentration it immediately ends the previously concentrated on spell.
### Upcasting Spells
Most spells in Eyum can be upcast, allowing spellcasters to increase their potency at the cost of significantly higher Mana consumption. Upcasting generally becomes less mana efficient the more times it is done making it more efficient in the long run to cast many spells instead of a large upcasted spell. 
##### What Can Be Upcast?
Most damage-dealing spells can be upcast, typically increasing:
- Damage output (e.g., a fireball dealing more damage).
- Number of projectiles (e.g., magic missiles launching additional bolts).
- Area of effect (e.g., an explosion covering a larger radius).
- Duration (e.g., spells lasting more turns or minutes).

Some spells may not have an upcast option if their effect cannot reasonably scale. If a spell does not list an upcast effect, it cannot be upcast. Always refer to the Spellbook for specific spell interactions.
### Detecting Magic
You may attempt to detect the presence of magic in an object, in an area, or on a person/creature. To do so you must make an Arcana check, the DC will be determined by the GM based on how obviously magical the thing is. Once you know that magic is there you may do another arcana check to attempt to learn more about the magic, what kind of magic it is, what it will do, etc. The GM may not allow you to make this check if your character is not learned in magic (has no levels in magical classes).
### Mana/Energy
All spell-casters possess a Mana Pool, which represents their available magical energy. The size of this pool is determined by class and increases with level.
- When casting a spell, a large portion of Mana is consumed upon activation.

There are three primary ways to recover Mana:
1. Short Rest - Resting for 1 hour restores 50% of total Mana.
2. Long Rest - Sleeping for 8 hours restores all lost Mana.
3. Mana Potions - Consuming potions can restore instant Mana, depending on the potion's strength.
