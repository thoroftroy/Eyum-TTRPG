Spells in Eyum require two primary components: Mana and Affinity.
- Mana represents the energy expenditure required to cast a spell.
- Affinity determines the strength and effectiveness of the spell.

Some spells use Vitality or Health instead of Mana as an energy source, these are explicitly stated in the spell description.
### Accuracy
Spell Attack Bonus = Spellcasting Modifier (from class) + Total Affinity Modifier (related to the spell)

When casting a spell that requires an attack roll, the caster rolls 1d20 + their total Affinity Modifier + their Spellcasting Modifier (based on class). The result is compared to the target’s Armor Class (AC). If the result is equal to or greater than the target’s AC, the spell hits.

Each spellcaster class uses a specific Spellcasting Modifier:

- Wizard, Energyweaver- Intelligence
    
- Cleric, Druid, Runemaster, Ranger - Wisdom
    
- Warlock, Sorcerer, Bard, Paladin - Charisma
    
- Others (Fighter, Rogue, etc.) - Will rarely use spells but use their Wisdom Modifier as the default.
    

- Generally speaking the physical classes can only cast spells if you multiclass with a magical class, in that case you would use that class's spellcasting modifier for your spells.
    

When multiclassing you can choose which modifier to use on a spell by spell basis. 

The Affinity Modifier is determined by the spell’s elemental components. You always add:

- The Affinity linked to the spell's element (e.g., Fire Affinity for a fire spell)
    
- Your Generic Affinity (which applies to all spells)
    

Example:  
A Wizard casting a Fire spell has:

- Intelligence Modifier: +3
    
- Fire Affinity: -2
    
- Generic Affinity: +1  
    Their total bonus is (+3 - 2 + 1) = +2.  
    They roll a d20 and add +2 to determine if the spell hits the target’s AC.
