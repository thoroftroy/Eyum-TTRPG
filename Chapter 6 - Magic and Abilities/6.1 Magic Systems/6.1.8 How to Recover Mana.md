There are three primary ways to recover Mana:

1. Short Rest - Resting for 1 hour restores 50% of total Mana.
    
2. Long Rest - Sleeping for 8 hours restores all lost Mana.
    
3. Mana Potions - Consuming potions can restore instant Mana, depending on the potion's strength.
    

So what If I run out of Mana?

This is why multiclassing is so important, if you run out of mana mid fight and donâ€™t know how to fight with bows or swords or anything else you are basically a sitting duck until you die (THIS HAS CHANGED WITH THE INTRODUCITON OF THE LEVEL 0 SPELLS).
