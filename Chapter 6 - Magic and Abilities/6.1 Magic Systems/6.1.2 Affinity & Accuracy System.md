Spell Attack Bonus = Spellcasting Modifier (from class) + Total Affinity Modifier (related to the spell)

  

When casting a spell that requires an attack roll, the caster rolls 1d20 + their total Affinity Modifier + their Spellcasting Modifier (based on class). The result is compared to the target’s Armor Class (AC). If the result is equal to or greater than the target’s AC, the spell hits.
