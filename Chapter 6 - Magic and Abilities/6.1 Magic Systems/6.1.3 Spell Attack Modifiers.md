Each spellcaster class uses a specific Spellcasting Modifier:

- Wizard, Energyweaver- Intelligence
    
- Cleric, Druid, Runemaster, Ranger - Wisdom
    
- Warlock, Sorcerer, Bard, Paladin - Charisma
    
- Others (Fighter, Rogue, etc.) - Will rarely use spells but use their Wisdom Modifier as the default.
    

- Generally speaking the physical classes can only cast spells if you multiclass with a magical class, in that case you would use that class's spellcasting modifier for your spells.
    

When multiclassing you can choose which modifier to use on a spell by spell basis. 

The Affinity Modifier is determined by the spell’s elemental components. You always add:

- The Affinity linked to the spell's element (e.g., Fire Affinity for a fire spell)
    
- Your Generic Affinity (which applies to all spells)
    

Example:  
A Wizard casting a Fire spell has:

- Intelligence Modifier: +3
    
- Fire Affinity: -2
    
- Generic Affinity: +1  
    Their total bonus is (+3 - 2 + 1) = +2.  
    They roll a d20 and add +2 to determine if the spell hits the target’s AC.
