When casting a spell, the caster applies their Affinity Modifier based on the spell’s element:

- Single-Affinity Spells: Use the caster’s Elemental Affinity (e.g., Fire) plus the Generic Affinity 
    
- Dual-Affinity Spells: Add together all applicable Affinity types for the final effect.
    
- Necrotic and Radiant Spells: Use Generic Affinity, as they do not belong to a specific elemental group. This also applies to any other element that is not listed.
    

Affinity scaling:

- In early levels, Generic Affinity spells tend to be more powerful, as negative modifiers in other Affinity types weaken their respective spells.
    
- In later levels, specialized Affinities become much stronger due to their stacking potential.
