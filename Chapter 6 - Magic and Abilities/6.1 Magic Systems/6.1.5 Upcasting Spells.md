Most spells in Eyum can be upcast, allowing spellcasters to increase their potency at the cost of significantly higher Mana consumption. Upcasting generally becomes less mana efficient the more times it is done making it more efficient in the long run to cast many spells instead of a large upcasted spell.Â 

##### What Can Be Upcast?

Most damage-dealing spells can be upcast, typically increasing:

- Damage output (e.g., a fireball dealing more damage).
    
- Number of projectiles (e.g., magic missiles launching additional bolts).
    
- Area of effect (e.g., an explosion covering a larger radius).
    
- Duration (e.g., spells lasting more turns or minutes).
    

Some spells may not have an upcast option if their effect cannot reasonably scale. If a spell does not list an upcast effect, it cannot be upcast. Always refer to the Spellbook for specific spell interactions.
