Xeran and Serenite runes can be combined within the same circle. However, doing so modifies the Affinity Requirement formula:

AR=1.9×(2.1x2.1)AR = 1.9 \times \left(\frac{2.1^x}{2.1}\right)AR=1.9×(2.12.1x​)

Then apply the Total Affinity Requirement (TAR) formula:

TAR=(AR×2.5)1.1TAR = \frac{(AR \times 2.5)}{1.1}TAR=1.1(AR×2.5)​

Key Effects of Combining Runes:

- Inherits Serenite’s Multi-Caster Bonus
    
- Fire and Earth runes do not function in a hybrid circle
    
- The Affinity Requirement is increased by approximately 2x
