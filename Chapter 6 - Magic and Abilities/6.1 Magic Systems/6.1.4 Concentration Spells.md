Some spells require a caster to maintain their focus over multiple turns. These are known as Concentration Spells. Maintaining concentration on such spells can be disrupted by distractions or attacks, requiring the caster to succeed on regular concentration saves.

Concentration Mechanics:

- Concentration Check:  
    At the start of each of the casterâ€™s turns while maintaining a concentration spell, they must succeed on a Concentration Save or the spell immediately ends.
    
- Concentration Save DC: 15
    
- Calculating Concentration Saves: Roll 1d20 + Affinity Modifier of the spell being concentrated on.
    
- Concentration and Damage: Whenever the caster takes damage while concentrating, they must immediately make an additional concentration save (DC 15). If the caster fails this save, concentration is broken, and the spell ends immediately.
    
- If you cast another spell that requires concentration it immediately ends the previously consentrated on spell.
