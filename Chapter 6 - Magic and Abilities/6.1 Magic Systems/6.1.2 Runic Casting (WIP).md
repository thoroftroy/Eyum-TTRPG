Runic magic is based on Runes, symbols that, when infused with energy, create magical effects. Runes can function individually or be combined in Runic Circles to form complex spells.
##### Runic Language Groups

Runes in Eyum belong to distinct linguistic groups, each with unique properties:
1. Xeran - The most widely used system, based on intent and adaptability.
2. Vindroth - A precise and structured system with strict casting rules.
3. Serenite - A language similar to Xeran but from another culture
### Runemasters
A Runemaster is a specialist who inscribes and activates runes. There are four primary types of Runemasters:
##### Augmenter
- Inscribes runes onto their own body, enhancing physical abilities.
- Common augmentations include strength boosts or explosive strikes.
- Unique feature: Fluid Runic Circles, which grow stronger or weaker based on the Runemaster’s power level.
##### Enchanter
- Engraves runes onto weapons, armor, and trinkets, granting permanent enchantments.
- The effectiveness of enchantments depends on material, caster power, and inscription method.
- Unlike Augmenters, Enchanters’ effects remain constant over time unless the rune is destroyed.
##### Trapper
- Creates runic circles to set magical traps on surfaces.
- Their runes activate when specific conditions are met, making them excellent for ambushes.
- Though powerful in a prepared environment, they are vulnerable when caught off guard.
##### Spellslinger
- Uses runes on projectiles to cast spells at range.
- Often combines Runic Casting with traditional magic for greater versatility.
- Viewed as less honorable by other Runemasters for relying on non-runic magic.

For more information see the Runemaster class in Section 3.3
### Affinities and Runic Power
Each person possesses Affinity Ratings that determine their proficiency with specific types of magic. These affinities influence both spellcasting and Runic effects.
##### Affinity Categories
- Elemental: Fire, Earth, Water, Air.
- Specialized: Craft, Physical, Utility, Creation.
- Generic: A universal Affinity that applies when no specific type exists.
##### Combination Affinities
Combination Affinities are formed by layering or combining multiple base Affinities to create powerful compound effects. These are most often used in advanced spellcasting and Runemastery.
Key Rules:
- When a spell or ability references a combination, you add all component Affinity values.
- If a component Affinity is repeated due to a nested recipe, it stacks.
- Example: Rebirth is defined as Life + Fire.
	- If Life = Creation + Water, then Rebirth = Creation + Water + Fire.
	- If your Creation Affinity is +3, it applies twice.

A list of all combination affinities is provided in 6.1.3
##### Crafting Affinity
Crafting Affinity determines how skilled a person is at carving runes into materials. There are several categories:

| Material Type | Affinity Bonus | Common Usage                    |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Generic       | No effect      | Any material not listed         |
| Dirt          | +1             | Basic carvings                  |
| Wood          | +1d4           | Temporary runes                 |
| Stone         | +7             | Common for most Runemasters     |
| Metal         | +3d6           | Used by Enchanters and Trappers |
| Gem           | +6d8           | Rare and expensive              |
| Skin          | +8d12+3d6      | Exclusive to Augmenters         |
Important:
- Skin inscriptions are highly unstable and may have unintended side effects. These usually come in the form of losing vitality or health whenever the circles are activated. 
- Stone is the most commonly used material due to its balance of power and availability.
### Xeran Circles
Runic Circles allow multiple runes to be linked together for increased power. However, they must follow strict structural rules:
- Every Runic Circle must contain at least 5 runes.
- At least 1 more Carbon Rune than all other runes combined is required.
- The size of the circle exponentially increases the required Affinity to activate it.
##### Affinity Requirement Formula:
The requirement number must be reached or exceeded  to successfully cast the spell/circle.

AR=0.2×(2x2)AR = 0.2 \times \left(\frac{2^x}{2}\right)AR=0.2×(22x​)

Where:
- AR = Required Affinity
- x = Total number of runes in the circle

Example Calculations;

| Runes in Circle | Required Affinity             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 5               | 3.2                           |
| 6               | 6                             |
| 7               | 12                            |
| 8               | 25                            |
| 10              | 209,715.2 (Nearly Impossible) |
### Serenite Circles
- No Fire or Earth runes exist in this system.
- Group castings require identical intent among all casters to succeed.
- Material Cost: Spells require Seron, a unique material found in Frostwood.
##### Seron Cost Equation:
Seron (grams)=Runes×3.2\text{Seron (grams)} = \text{Runes} \times 3.2Seron (grams)=Runes×3.2
### Combined Casting
Xeran and Serenite runes can be combined within the same circle. However, doing so modifies the Affinity Requirement formula:

AR=1.9×(2.1x2.1)AR = 1.9 \times \left(\frac{2.1^x}{2.1}\right)AR=1.9×(2.12.1x​)

Then apply the Total Affinity Requirement (TAR) formula:

TAR=(AR×2.5)1.1TAR = \frac{(AR \times 2.5)}{1.1}TAR=1.1(AR×2.5)​

Key Effects of Combining Runes:
- Inherits Serenite’s Multi-Caster Bonus
- Fire and Earth runes do not function in a hybrid circle
- The Affinity Requirement is increased by approximately 2x
### Vindroth Magic
Vindroth spells are written as structured sentences rather than circles. The spell’s shape and length determine its power:

| Shape     | Effect                                                 | Element |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Circle    | Stable and reliable (+4)                               | Earth   |
| Triangle  | Slightly unstable, stronger (+2d4)                     | Air     |
| Polygon   | Stronger with more points, but highly unstable (+2d12) | Water   |
| Irregular | Variable effects, commonly used for traps              | Fire    |

Vindroth spells can be spoken aloud, but doing so greatly reduces effectiveness compared to written inscriptions, granting a -10 penalty
