Alchemy in Eyum is not a form of spellcasting but rather an advanced craft that harnesses chemical and elemental reactions to produce potions, powders, gels, and other alchemical concoctions. The effectiveness of an alchemical mixture depends on the caster’s Affinity with the elements involved in its creation.

### Alchemical Core Mechanics
- Formula Preparation: You can prepare 3 formulas per long rest, +1 per level.
- Concoction Use: All concoctions are one-use. Once thrown or drunk, they must be remade.
- Experimental Mixtures: Combine concoctions mid-combat (Action, DC = 10 + # of effects combined).
- Alchemical Efficiency (Passive): You may reuse a Stabilizer or Catalyst for free once per long rest.
- Transmutation Bench (Optional Crafting Upgrade): Unlocks at Level 5; allows combining rare reagents into synthetic versions of others.
##### Advanced Alchemy System
Alchemical crafting uses Base Ingredients, Catalysts, and Stabilizers, influenced by Affinity Scores.

| Ingredient Role | Description                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base Ingredient | Determines the potion’s primary effect type (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, etc.) |
| Catalyst        | Enhances or transforms the effect, e.g. adds healing, volatility, range     |
| Stabilizer      | Prevents failure or side effects. Needed for reliability                    |

| Generic  | Minor boosts to any concoction                            |
##### Creating an Alchemical Mixture
An alchemical mixture is made using base ingredients, catalysts, and stabilizers. Each ingredient type contributes to the final effect of the potion or compound.
1. Base Ingredients - Determine the core effect of the potion.
	- Fire-based ingredients create combustibles and explosives.
	- Water-based ingredients focus on healing and purification.
	- Air-based ingredients enhance mobility or produce vapor-based effects.
	- Earth-based ingredients increase durability and toughness.
2. Catalysts - Enhance or modify the Effect.
	- Common catalysts include magical herbs, distilled minerals, and infused essences.
3. Stabilizers - Ensure the potion remains safe and doesn’t degrade or explode.
	- Without stabilizers, unstable potions may have unintended side effects.
##### Alchemy and Affinity
A character’s Alchemy Skill and Elemental Affinity influence the strength of their creations.

| Water         | Strengthens healing, purification, and fluid-based potions.                  |
| Air           | Improves speed, gaseous effects, and movement-based brews.                   |
| Earth         | Increases resistance, fortification, and armor-enhancing potions.            |
| Craft         | Determines efficiency in combining ingredients and refining compounds.       |
| Utility       | Boosts effectiveness of general-use potions such as antidotes and tonics.    |
