Runic Circles allow multiple runes to be linked together for increased power. However, they must follow strict structural rules:

- Every Runic Circle must contain at least 5 runes.
    
- At least 1 more Carbon Rune than all other runes combined is required.
    
- The size of the circle exponentially increases the required Affinity to activate it.
    

##### Affinity Requirement Formula:

The requirement number must be reached or exceeded  to successfully cast the spell/circle. 

  

AR=0.2×(2x2)AR = 0.2 \times \left(\frac{2^x}{2}\right)AR=0.2×(22x​)

Where:

- AR = Required Affinity
    
- x = Total number of runes in the circle
