Energymancy is how Energyweavers move energy. Spells will carry most of the specificity; this section defines only the universal rules your class and those spells rely on.
### Costs, Cap, and Casting
- **Mana Cost:** Energymancy has **Mana Cost 0**.
- **Transfer Cap (Throughput):** Per casting you may move up to **TP = your current Mana**.
- **Action Economy:** Unless a spell says otherwise, Energymancy takes **1 Action**.    
- **Attack/Save Defaults:**
    - **Spell Attack** = INT mod + Proficiency + relevant **Subclass Affinity** (never add Generic).
    - **Save DC** = 10 + INT mod + Proficiency + relevant **Subclass Affinity**.
### Source, Target, Sink (Conservation)
- **Source:** where energy comes from (creature, object, area, phenomenon).
- **Target:** where the primary effect applies (may equal Source for equalization).
- **Sink:** where displaced energy goes (ground, air, metal, coolant, capacitor, living target, you, etc.).
- **Validity.** A casting is **illegal and has no effect** if you cannot name a legal Source and a legal Sink for **all** TP you intend to move.
### Per-Type Baselines (per 1 TP moved)
Baseline magnitude when you use **Basic Transfer** (spells may override):
- **Thermal:** 1d4 fire (adding heat) or 1d4 cold (removing heat).
- **Kinetic:** 1d6 bludgeoning.
- **Chemical:** 1 TP stored or dumped; if dumped as damage then half of the damage will be **Fire** and the other half with be **Force**.
- **Gravitational:** 1d6 force.
- **Sonic:** 1d4 force.
- **Electromagnetic:** 1d6 lightning or 1d6 radiant (light).
- **Vitalic:** +1 Vitality, +1 Health, or +1 Mana.
### Media & Range (the important part)
**At SL 1 in any subclass you must touch both the Source and the Target.**  
As SL increases you gain range via media the energy can travel through. **Metal is easy, air is hard.** Ranges below refer to the **length of the total path** from you to the Source/Target/Sink along a valid medium. “Joints” are the number of times the medium changes (bar → water tank → pipe = 2 joints).
##### **Thermal**
- **SL 1:** Touch both ends.
- **SL 2:** Metal only, ≤10 ft, 0 joints.
- **SL 3:** Metal/Water, ≤30 ft, 1 joint.
- **SL 4:** Metal/Water/Stone, ≤60 ft, 2 joints.
- **SL 5:** Metal/Water/Stone/Wood/Earth, ≤120 ft, 3 joints.
- _Air is not a valid Thermal medium by default; specific spells may allow it._
##### **Kinetic**
- **SL 1:** Touch both ends.
- **SL 2:** Continuous **rigid** path ≤10 ft, 0 joints.
- **SL 3:** Rigid path ≤30 ft, 1 joint.
- **SL 4:** Rigid path ≤60 ft, 2 joints.
- **SL 5:** Rigid path ≤120 ft, 3 joints.
- _Air/Ground is not a valid Kinetic medium by default; specific spells may allow it._
##### **Chemical**
_Note for GMs_: Due to the nature of this SL it is recommended to use the Carrying Capacity rules if you have a player using the Chemical subclass. 
- **Rule.** Chemical energy can be **stored in non-living objects**. Each object has a **TP storage limit**; if you **exceed** that limit during storage, the object **explodes immediately**. 
- **Explosion radius:** `stored TP × 0.1 ft` (round up to the nearest foot).
- **Explosion damage:** use the **Per-Type Baselines** for the **energy type stored**. When an object explodes it is destroyed leaving little to nothing behind unless the object is magical or enchanted in which case the energy will be released but the object will not be destroyed. 
- **Intentional release:** Intentionally releasing the energy can be done in one of two ways:
	- Explosive - Instantly explode all the energy stored in an object, follows the same rules as an overload. 
	- Siphon - Siphon some energy out of the object and convert it into something else. 
- **Scaling:** Storage **scales with Chemical SL**, for each level in Chemical SL you may multiply the TP per lb by 2. For example, Stone has a TP per lb of 1.0 so you can store 1 TP for each lb of stone at a Chemical SL of 1. At Chemical SL 2 you can now store 2 TP per 1 lbs of stone and so on.

##### **Gravitational**
- **Requires an anchor point** you can see.
- **Anchor range:** SL 1: touch; SL 2: 10 ft; SL 3: 30 ft; SL 4: 60 ft; SL 5: 120 ft.
- Mass limits are on the subclass (see class page).
##### **Sonic (needs a medium)**
- **SL 1:** Touch both ends through a solid.
- **SL 2:** Air/Water straight line ≤10 ft.
- **SL 3:** ≤30 ft, 1 bend around an opening.
- **SL 4:** ≤60 ft, 2 bends; thin wood attenuates but allows passage.
- **SL 5:** ≤120 ft, 3 bends; dense stone/metal significantly attenuate or block unless a spell says otherwise.
##### **Electromagnetic**
- **Electricity:** Use **Path Difficulty (PD)** and SL check: you can conduct only if **SL ≥ PD**.
    - PD chart: Metal 0, Brine 1, Fresh Water 2, Flesh/Wet Wood 3, Dry Wood 4, Stone 5, Air 6.
    - **Range:** SL 1 touch; SL 2: 10 ft (PD 0); SL 3: 30 ft (PD ≤2); SL 4: 60 ft (PD ≤4); SL 5: 120 ft (PD ≤6).
    - If multiple paths exist, current takes the **lowest PD** path; only spells may override this.
- **Light:** Line of sight only. **Range:** 10/30/60/60/120 ft at SL 1–5 respectively (mirrors/prisms per spell).
##### **Vitalic (living only)**
- **Range to living Target:** SL 1: touch; SL 2: 5 ft via a living contact chain; SL 3: 15 ft LoS; SL 4: 30 ft LoS; SL 5: 60 ft LoS.
### Multiclassing & Current Mana
- **Current vs Maximum.** Transfer Cap uses **current Mana**. If you spend Mana on other classes’ spells, your Energymancy throughput drops until you recover Mana.
- **Recovery.** Anything that restores Mana raises your Energymancy throughput immediately.
