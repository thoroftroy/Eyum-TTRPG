All spellcasters possess a Mana Pool, which represents their available magical energy. The size of this pool is determined by class and increases with level.

- When casting a spell, a large portion of Mana is consumed upon activation.
    
- If a spell requires Concentration, it will drain Mana continuously each turn.
    

Some abilities and external forces can affect Mana regeneration and depletion. For further details, refer to the Spellbook.

##### Mana Regeneration & Conservation

Magic in The World of Eyum requires Mana, a resource that depletes as spells are cast.
