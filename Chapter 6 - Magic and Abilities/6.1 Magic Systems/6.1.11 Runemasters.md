A Runemaster is a specialist who inscribes and activates runes. There are four primary types of Runemasters:

Augmenter

- Inscribes runes onto their own body, enhancing physical abilities.
    
- Common augmentations include strength boosts or explosive strikes.
    
- Unique feature: Fluid Runic Circles, which grow stronger or weaker based on the Runemaster’s power level.
    

Enchanter

- Engraves runes onto weapons, armor, and trinkets, granting permanent enchantments.
    
- The effectiveness of enchantments depends on material, caster power, and inscription method.
    
- Unlike Augmenters, Enchanters’ effects remain constant over time unless the rune is destroyed.
    

Trapper

- Creates runic circles to set magical traps on surfaces.
    
- Their runes activate when specific conditions are met, making them excellent for ambushes.
    
- Though powerful in a prepared environment, they are vulnerable when caught off guard.
    

Spellslinger

- Uses runes on projectiles to cast spells at range.
    
- Often combines Runic Casting with traditional magic for greater versatility.
    
- Viewed as less honorable by other Runemasters for relying on non-runic magic.
