##### Serenite Circles

- No Fire or Earth runes exist in this system.
    
- Group castings require identical intent among all casters to succeed.
    
- Material Cost: Spells require Seron, a unique material found in Frostwood.
    

##### Seron Cost Equation:

Seron (grams)=Runes×3.2\text{Seron (grams)} = \text{Runes} \times 3.2Seron (grams)=Runes×3.2

##### Vindroth Magic

Vindroth spells are written as structured sentences rather than circles. The spell’s shape and length determine its power:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Shape|Effect|Element|
|Circle|Stable and reliable (+4)|Earth|
|Triangle|Slightly unstable, stronger (+2d4)|Air|
|Polygon|Stronger with more points, but highly unstable (+2d12)|Water|
|Irregular|Variable effects, commonly used for traps|Fire|

Vindroth spells can be spoken aloud, but doing so greatly reduces effectiveness compared to written inscriptions, granting a -10 penalty
