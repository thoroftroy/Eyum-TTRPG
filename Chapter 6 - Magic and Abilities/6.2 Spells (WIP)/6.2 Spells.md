Note: This is a reference section, not a reading assignment. Spellcasters only need to read the spells they can access based on their class and level. Use this section to find options and copy down relevant spell details onto your sheet.

Many spells exist in multiple versions, meaning that while they share the same name, their effects and Mana costs may vary depending on the class that learns them. 

When learning a new spell, you may choose to learn a Generic spell instead of a class-specific one. Generic Spells are universally accessible and function the same regardless of which class learns them.

Below is a list of all spells currently in the TRPG (WIP); This is not currently complete at all, I am still debating the format for the descriptions and I am missing many of the spells.
