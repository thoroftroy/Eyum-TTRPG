Mana Cost: 24  
Affinity: Earth  
Range: 60ft (wall up to 30ft long, 10ft high, 5ft thick)  
Concentration: Yes (5 turns)  
Effect: Create a living wall of needles. The wall **blocks movement**. A creature forced through it takes 3d6 Piercing damage (Dex Save DC 16 halves). Attacks through the wall are at **disadvantage**; it does **not** block line of effect for spells. The wall can be ended early by effects that cancel active magic (see **Dispel Magic**).  
Upcast: Extend length (+10ft) per x2 Mana.
