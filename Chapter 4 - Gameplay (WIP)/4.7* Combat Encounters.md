Combat encounters should be balanced, challenging but fair. Don’t throw overpowered enemies at your players out of frustration, but it’s absolutely okay for players to face consequences if they make reckless decisions. Mix up combat styles with different types of encounters: hordes of weak enemies for easy wins, tactical fights with strong opponents, or even encounters where running away is the only smart option. Adding unique mechanics or “gimmicks” can make battles more dynamic and memorable.
