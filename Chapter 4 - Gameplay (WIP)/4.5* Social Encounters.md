Social encounters are the heart of any TTRPG. These moments allow players to roleplay, interact with NPCs, shop, gather information, and truly immerse themselves in the world. Make sure there are plenty of opportunities for conversation and that NPCs are unique and memorable. The more interesting and diverse the NPCs, the more fun your players will have engaging with them.
