When running a session, the GM is in charge, acting as the primary storyteller and referee. Players will almost never follow your planned storyline perfectly, they will always find unexpected ways to solve puzzles or defeat bosses. Be prepared to improvise and adjust your narrative to accommodate their creativity (or occasional foolishness). Focus on making sure everyone is having fun, settle any disputes, roleplay NPCs, and maintain the flow of the session. Visual aids, character art, maps, and background music can enhance the experience.
