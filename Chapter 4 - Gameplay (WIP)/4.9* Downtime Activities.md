Not every moment has to be filled with combat or high-stakes drama. Give your players time to breathe between major events. Let them shop, build relationships, craft items, or simply explore the world at their own pace. Downtime allows players to connect with the setting and each other, making the next big adventure even more impactful.

Training and Learning New Abilities

- Characters can spend downtime training in a new skill, language, or proficiency.
