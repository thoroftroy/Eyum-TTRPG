The role of the Game Master is simple: ensure the players have a fun and engaging roleplaying experience. As the GM, you are the storyteller, guiding players through the world you've created, with them as the main characters. You'll describe events, tell players when to roll, determine their successes or failures, and control NPCs and enemies during encounters to make the game more exciting.
