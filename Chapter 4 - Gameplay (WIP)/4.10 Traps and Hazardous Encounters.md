Traps are hidden or triggered devices, spells, or hazards designed to injure, restrain, delay, or mislead intruders. They can be mechanical, magical, environmental, or hybrid. Traps are often encountered in dungeons, ruins, fortresses, or wild terrain, and play a major role in exploration and dungeon-crawling gameplay.

Trap Types

Traps fall into one or more of the following categories:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Type|Description|
|Mechanical|Physical mechanisms, pressure plates, crossbows, pits, swinging blades|
|Magical|Spell-based effects, runes, glyphs, delayed curses, teleportation triggers|
|Environmental|Natural hazards, collapsing tunnels, acid pools, toxic spores|
|Hybrid|Mixed triggers, mechanical trap activates magical effect or vice versa|

Trap Structure

Each trap entry includes the following:

- Trigger: How it activates (step, sound, line of sight, proximity)
    
- Detection DC: What a Search or Investigation check must beat to spot it
    
- Disarm DC: The Dexterity (Tools) or Intelligence (Arcana) DC to disable or neutralize it
    
- Effect: The outcome if triggered (damage, condition, movement, alarm, etc.)
    
- Reset: Whether the trap resets, breaks, or requires manual rearming
