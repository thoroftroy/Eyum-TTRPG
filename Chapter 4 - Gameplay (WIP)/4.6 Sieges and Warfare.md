Sieges are prolonged, strategic conflicts centered around fortified locations, such as castles, walled cities, or strongholds, and the equipment used to defend or dismantle them. These rules expand standard combat to support large-scale engagements and structural damage.

General Siege Structure

A siege is divided into two strategic sides:

- Defenders: Fortified behind walls, towers, or gates. Often supported by defensive weapons, terrain advantage, and time.
    
- Attackers: Assaulting the structure using siege engines, spells, climbing tactics, or brute force.
    

A siege is not a single battle but a layered encounter made up of multiple objectives: breaching walls, surviving counterfire, storming inner keeps, disabling defensive magic, and securing critical zones.

Siege Equipment

Siege equipment is treated as objects with AC, HP, and structure ratings, and may require multiple characters to operate.

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Equipment|Function|HP (avg)|AC|Notes|
|Battering Ram|Destroys gates (Double damage vs doors/gates)|250 HP|12|Requires 3+ operators|
|Ballista|Fires massive bolts, strong vs creatures|100 HP|14|4d12 Piercing, Range 200ft|
|Catapult|Lobs massive stones (AoE)|180 HP|10|5d10 Bludgeoning, 10ft radius|
|Siege Ladder|Allows climbing walls|30 HP|10|Destroyed if pushed/tipped|
|Siege Tower|Mobile protected platform|300 HP|16|Protects troops inside|
|Trebuchet|High-arc siege weapon, good vs structures|200 HP|10|6d12 Bludgeoning, long setup|
|Boiling Oil Trap|Defensive AoE from above|,|,|4d8 Fire in 10ft drop zone|
|Wall Reinforcement|Adds +4 AC to one section|,|+4|Requires prior setup|

Siege Damage Rules

Walls, Gates, and Structures use special object durability rules:

- Wall HP per 10-ft section:
    

- Wood: 150 HP (AC 12)
    
- Stone: 300 HP (AC 17)
    
- Reinforced/Runed: 400-500 HP (AC 20+)
    

Break Effects: When a wall section reaches 0 HP, it collapses, potentially causing falling damage and opening a breach.

Siege Critical Hits: If an attack exceeds the hit DC by 5+, deal double damage.

Magic vs Structures: Spells that deal Fire, Force, or Thunder damage affect structures normally. Necrotic, Psychic, or Charm-based effects usually have no effect unless targeting magical wards.

Siege Rounds and Time

Each Siege Round represents 1 minute of real time. This accommodates the slower nature of siege weapon loading and movement.

- Characters may act as normal using Action Points (AP), Bonus Action Points (BAP), and Reactions.
    
- Siege weapons may have cooldowns or multi-character load times.
    

Victory Conditions

GMs are encouraged to define specific siege phases or victory objectives, such as:

- Breach the outer wall
    
- Open the main gate
    
- Kill the enemy commander
    
- Secure the inner keep
    

Siege Combat Tips

- Use a larger grid or abstract zones: e.g., Gate Front, West Tower, Inner Yard.
    
- Mix character-scale encounters (assassins, tunnels, sabotage) with structure-scale assaults.
    
- Allow players to command squads or perform heroic actions that turn the tide.
