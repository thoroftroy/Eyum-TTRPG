**The World of Eyum** is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) inspired by Dungeons & Dragons 5e, rebuilt for long-term scalability and a consistent, integrated magic system. That can sound complex, but at its heart this is a game you play with friends to tell memorable stories together. Eyum is designed for campaigns that grow with you: begin as a farmhand, thief, or soldier and, through many sessions, rise toward demigod-level challenges. This handbook assumes no prior experience and walks you step-by-step through play and progression.
## What this game is (and isn’t)
A TTRPG is a collaborative storytelling game. Players each control a unique character; a Narrator or Game Master (GM) presents the world, portrays its inhabitants, and adjudicates outcomes. There’s no single “win” screen: some tables play short **one-shots**, others play long **campaigns** with evolving arcs; your goal is to complete your story and enjoy the journey.
## Complexity, explained
Eyum is **beginner-accessible**, but not simple. You can learn as you go, but playing well, especially when building advanced characters or running the game, requires reading and understanding the rules. Expect depth; the system was built to scale without collapsing under “infinite power creep.”
## Design philosophy
Eyum favors **fantasy experience** over realism. Roleplay is central, and **power fantasy** is embraced, but so is opposition. As you grow stronger, so will your challenges; if everything is “overpowered,” nothing truly is. The rules aim to maintain escalation with a sense of balance.
## Rulings and disagreements
No rulebook can cover every situation. When ambiguity arises, the **GM’s ruling is final**, groups may bend or ignore rules with GM support, but rules-lawyering to exploit wording is discouraged. The priority is collaborative fun, not loopholes.
## Your first steps
If you read only one rules chapter before session one, make it **Section 2: Core Rules**; it provides the essential mechanics for understanding play. You don’t need to memorize everything, just learn the flow (roll, add modifiers, interpret results) and reference specifics during play. For tone and expectations, many groups hold a **Session Zero** to align on themes, technology level, and character fit (group or individual prologues are both valid). Starting on the same page ensures a stronger first session.
