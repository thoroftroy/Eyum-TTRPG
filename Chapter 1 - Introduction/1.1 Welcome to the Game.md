The World of Eyum is a tabletop roleplaying game inspired by Dungeons & Dragons 5e, but built to be more scalable and feature a fully integrated, consistent magic system. That might sound complex, but don’t worry. At its core, this is a game about having fun with your friends.

It’s designed for long-term campaigns, where you can start as a simple farmhand or thief and eventually rise to become a demigod. Whether you’re new to tabletop RPGs or a seasoned player, this handbook will walk you through everything you need to know, step by step, assuming no prior experience.

Note on Complexity:  
The World of Eyum is beginner-accessible, but not simple. This handbook is designed to walk you through everything step by step, even if you’ve never played a TTRPG before. That said, it’s also a deep and complex system. To play well, you’ll need to read and understand the rules, especially if you plan to build advanced characters or run the game as a Game Master (GM).

Note on Design Philosophy:  
The World of Eyum is not a simulation of realism, it is a fantasy experience. While roleplaying is central, the game also embraces power fantasy. You will become powerful, but so will your enemies. If everything is overpowered, then nothing truly is. The system is built to scale with intensity while maintaining some semblance of balance.
