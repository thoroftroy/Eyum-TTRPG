You can run Session Zero as a **group meeting** (everyone together) and/or **individual meetings** (private character builds, backstory hooks, short prologues). Many GMs do both. The goal is that by Session One, everyone is immersed, prepared, and aligned. It is **imperative** that a session zero is run in order for a long running campaign to function correctly. 

Use this agenda to cover what Eyum expects you to decide up front:

1. **Tone & Themes
    - State the campaign’s intended **tone** (e.g., grim survival, heroic myth, political thriller) and the kind of **themes** you’ll explore (combat challenge, exploration, moral dilemmas, character-driven arcs).
    - Ask players what they want to experience; look for overlap. You’re not dictating tone, you’re aligning the table around a shared experience.

2. **Level Range, Power Curve, Progression, and Lethality**
    - Decide **starting level**, how fast characters advance (**milestone** or **XP**), and how **deadly** the game is intended to feel.
    - Ensure that the players are made somewhat aware of how dangerous the campaign will be. If the characters are being thrown into a grim-dark survival at level 1 and never really level up but wanted a power fantasy, they won't be very happy. 

3. **Homebrew & Rule Modifications (what’s allowed)**
    - Clarify allowances for homebrew rules.
    - You don’t have to allow anything you’re not comfortable with; enforce **consistency and fairness**.
    - Remember, you always have the final say, no homebrew is allowed without you explicitly giving permission. 

4. **PvP & Intra-Party Conflict Policy**
    - Decide whether **PC-vs-PC** combat or betrayal arcs are on the table. Some groups enjoy high-drama tension; others want strict cooperation. Align limits and handling **before** play begins.

5. **Table Safety, Boundaries, and Pacing**
    - Flag any **heavy content** that might appear (e.g., torture, grief, sexual content) so players can opt out or set limits.
    - Agree on **session length**, **frequency**, and what happens when someone **can’t attend**. Consistency helps everyone stay invested.

6. **Character Integration (why the party exists)**
    - Establish how the PCs know (or will come to know) each other. Encourage **shared backstory elements** (overlapping goals, linked hometowns, mutual enemies) so the party has momentum from scene one.
    - Avoid introducing total strangers with no glue, unless that’s an intentional part of the design, as that makes it difficult to play the game. 

7. **Player Preferences (optional but recommended)**
    - Ask a few quick questions to tune content:  
        “What scenes do you hope to see?”  
        “Do you prefer roleplay, combat, or problem-solving?”  
        “What instantly makes a session more fun for you?”
    - Use answers to guide prep so everyone gets regular moments tailored to their interests.

8. **Set Clear Expectations (close the loop)**
    - Summarize decisions so the table leaves with the same understanding of tone, rules, and realism. This is a GM best-practice the Handbook calls out explicitly for Session Zero.

**Bottom line:** A good Session Zero is **foundational**, it prevents confusion, discourages bad-faith play, and builds trust. Don’t skip it; don’t rush it. This is how you turn a pile of character sheets into a real adventuring party.
