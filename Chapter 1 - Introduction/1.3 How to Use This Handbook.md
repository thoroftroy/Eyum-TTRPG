Not every section of this book will apply to you right now, and that’s okay. Use the **Table of Contents** to jump straight to the parts you need and avoid overload. Some sections are marked with a **★**; those are for **Game Masters**. Players can safely skip ★ sections unless your GM asks otherwise. Other sections serve _both_ audiences; even rules mostly used by the GM can be helpful for players to understand.

If terms are unfamiliar, check the **Glossary** in [[9.1 Glossary of Terms]]. Not everything will click immediately, sometimes you need to keep reading to see how pieces fit together.
### New players (start here)
1. **Chapter 2 - Core Rules.** ([[2.1 Basic Mechanics]]) Learn the flow you’ll use every session (basic mechanics, actions, turn order, health/vitality, conditions, damage types, actually playing).
2.  **Chapter 3 - Character Creation** ([[3.1 Step-by-Step Character Creation]]) Follow it the first time you build a character; you can tweak later with GM approval.
## Reading tips that speed play
- You don’t need to learn everything at once. Focus on your character and immediate mechanics; learn the rest through play.
- The **GM is your guide and referee**; they describe how the world reacts and keep the game moving.
- Bring the basics each session (character sheet, dice or dice app, pencil/notes, and, if used, mini or token).
## How to Read Dice Notation
Throughout this book you’ll see terms like **1d6**, **2d20**, or “roll a d20.” This shorthand tells you what dice to roll and how many: the **number before** the “d” is how many dice; the **number after** the “d” is the number of sides. Examples: **1d4** (one 4-sided), **2d6** (two 6-sided), **1d20 + 2d12** (roll and add them all together). You’ll use different dice for different actions, spells, or effects; this guide will always tell you which dice to roll when.
