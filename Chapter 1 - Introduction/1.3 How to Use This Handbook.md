Not every section of this handbook will apply to you, and that’s okay. Use the Table of Contents (TBA) to quickly find what you need and avoid information overload.
- Players will primarily use this book to create characters, level up, and manage their abilities, items, and stats.
- Game Masters (GMs) will use the majority of the content, including rules for worldbuilding, narrative structure, combat encounters, and managing the game world.

Some sections are marked with a *, these are for Game Masters only. If you’re a player, you can safely skip those unless your GM tells you otherwise.
Other sections are written with both audiences in mind. Even if a rule is mostly used by the GM, it’s often helpful for players to understand how the system works to better engage with the game.
Many words used in this handbook will be confusing if you aren’t familiar with TTRPG’s, there is a Glossary at the end of the handbook (section 9.1) that explains most of those terms. 
Also keep in mind that not everything will make sense immediately, sometimes you need to keep reading to get the bigger picture. 
#### How to Read Dice Notation
Throughout this book, you’ll see terms like 1d6, 2d20, or “roll a d20.” This shorthand describes what kind of dice to roll and how many.
Here’s how to read it:
- The “d” stands for dice.
- The number before the “d” tells you how many dice to roll.
- The number after the “d” tells you how many sides the dice have.

For example:
- 1d4 means roll one 4-sided die.
- 2d6 means roll two 6-sided dice.
- 1d20 + 2d12 means roll one 20-sided die and two 12-sided dice, then add all the results together.
You’ll use different dice for different actions, spells, or effects, don’t worry, this guide will tell you which dice to roll when.
