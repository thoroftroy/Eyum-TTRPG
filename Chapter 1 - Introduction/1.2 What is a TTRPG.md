A TTRPG is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game. It’s played around a table (or virtually) with multiple players. Each player controls a unique character, represented by a character sheet that outlines their abilities and actions. A Narrator or Game Master (GM) leads the game, guiding the story, controlling the world, and playing the roles of non-player characters (NPCs). Players roleplay their characters (PC), make decisions, and work together (or against each other) to shape the narrative.

#### How do you win?

In The World of Eyum, and tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) in general, there isn’t a traditional “win” condition like in most board games or video games.

Instead, the game continues as long as the group wants to keep playing. You might play a one-shot, which is a short story that begins and ends in a single session. Or you might join a campaign, which is a longer adventure that unfolds over many sessions, often with an overarching plot.

Your goal isn’t to “win,” but to complete your story, whether that means saving the world, defeating a villain, or just surviving. The journey, choices, and roleplaying are the core of the game, not a final score or victory screen.
