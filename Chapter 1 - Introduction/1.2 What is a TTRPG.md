A **TTRPG** is a _Tabletop Roleplaying Game_. You can play it around a physical table or virtually with friends. Each player controls a unique character recorded on a **character sheet** (your stats, abilities, items, and options). One person, called the **Narrator** or **Game Master (GM)**, presents the world, portrays non-player characters (NPCs), and adjudicates outcomes so the story keeps moving. Together, you roleplay your characters, make choices, and collaborate (sometimes compete) to shape a shared narrative.
## Who does what at the table
- **The GM** runs the game: describes the world, controls NPCs and enemies, and decides outcomes.
- **The players** each control a single **PC** (player character), deciding what that character says, does, and feels within the GM’s scenes.
## What play actually looks like
Play unfolds in scenes. A typical moment goes like this: the GM **describes a scene**; players **react** by saying what they do; if the action is risky or uncertain, the GM **calls for a roll** (often a d20) and compares your total to a **Difficulty Class (DC)** to determine success or failure, then narrates the outcome.
### Combat as structured play
When a fight breaks out, Eyum uses turn-based structure: **roll initiative** to set order, take your **turn** (move, action, bonus action, free actions), and sometimes use **reactions** outside your turn. The GM controls enemies.
## “How do you win?”
You don’t “win” Eyum the way you win a board game or video game. You might play a **one-shot** that begins and ends in a single session, or a **campaign** that unfolds over many sessions with an overarching plot. The goal is to _complete your story_, save a town, topple a villain, or just survive, not to reach a final score or victory screen.
