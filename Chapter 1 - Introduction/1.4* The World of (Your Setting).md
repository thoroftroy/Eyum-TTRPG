As the Game Master, you are the storyteller and the architect of the world; Eyum is a flexible framework you can shape to your table. That said, the world exists for the players, not the other way around. If you want full control, write a novel. A TTRPG is collaborative: prioritize your players’ enjoyment (and your own); the best games happen when everyone at the table is having fun.

Before your campaign begins, run a **Session Zero**: a pre-game meeting to align expectations, build characters, and most importantly, agree on tone and themes.
### Why Tone Matters
Tone frames every decision. Mixing a cheerful, whimsical character into a bleak, post-apocalyptic game can work only if everyone is intentionally on that wavelength. Consistency keeps the table on the same story.
### World Tone and Technology Level
Eyum defaults to **medieval fantasy**, but the system is flexible. You can homebrew steampunk, cosmic horror, or post-apocalyptic biopunk, just make sure players know what experience they’re signing up for. The most important thing is that everyone’s telling the same kind of story.
