As the Game Master, you are the storyteller and the architect of the world. The world of Eyum serves as a flexible framework, you can shape it however you like.

That said, remember: the world exists for the players, not the other way around. If you want full control, go write a novel. A TTRPG is about collaboration and creating memorable stories with your players. Prioritize their enjoyment, but don’t forget that yours matters too. The best games happen when everyone at the table is having fun.

### 1.5* Core Themes and Tone

Before your campaign begins, it’s essential to run a Session Zero, a pre-game meeting where the group discusses expectations, builds characters, and most importantly, agrees on the tone and themes of the game.

#### Why Tone Matters

Tone sets the foundation for the entire campaign. Is your world a grimdark survival horror where trust is rare and death is frequent? Or is it a lighthearted, whimsical adventure full of chaos and jokes?

These expectations matter. A cheerful unicorn princess may feel wildly out of place in a bleak, post-apocalyptic wasteland, unless everyone is in on the joke. Whatever the tone, the key is consistency.

#### World Tone and Technology Level

The default setting of Eyum is medieval fantasy, but the system is highly flexible. You can homebrew in steampunk cities, cosmic horror, or post-apocalyptic biopunk, just make sure your players know what they’re signing up for.

The most important thing is that everyone’s telling the same kind of story.

#### Session Zero

A Session Zero can be run in two ways:

- Group Session Zero: Bring all players together to create characters, discuss party dynamics, and align on tone, rules, and boundaries.
    
- Individual Session Zeroes: Meet with each player separately to build their character in more detail, explore personal backstories, and run short prologues that end where the party will meet up.
    

Either method is valid, some GMs even do both. The goal is to ensure that when Session One begins, everyone is immersed, prepared, and on the same page.
