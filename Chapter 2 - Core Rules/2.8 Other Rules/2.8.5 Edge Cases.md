This section documents edge cases and situational rules that were not explicitly defined elsewhere in the Handbook. These rulings arose during playtesting when ambiguous interactions, unusual builds, or rare circumstances produced unclear outcomes.

The intent of these rules is **clarity and consistency**, not authority. They represent **tested resolutions**, not mandates. If a rule in this section conflicts with your table’s expectations, tone, or narrative needs, the **GM is encouraged to override it**. Nothing here supersedes GM judgment.

These rulings exist to prevent stalled play and rules arguments, not to restrict creativity.  
Use them **as written**, **as inspiration**, or **not at all**, according to what best serves your table.
## 2.8.5.1 Layered Stonekin Energyweavers
Layered Stonekin use Vitality plus two separate HP pools (Outer Layer HP and Inner Core HP), which does not map cleanly to Energymancy’s standard assumptions. When a Stonekin with the layered model takes levels in Energyweaver, treat them as having four distinct energy pools: Mana, Vitality, Outer Layer HP, and Inner Core HP.

For Energymancy purposes, both HP layers function as normal HP pools. Conversions involving HP use a 1:1 ratio between either HP layer. Excess energy that converts into HP damage is applied to the Outer Layer HP first, then the Inner Core HP, following normal Stonekin damage order. If the Inner Core HP reaches 0, the Stonekin dies as usual. Additional you may use Convert Energy to move Inner Core HP to Outer Layer HP freely, but at the 1:1 ratio. 

Vitality behaves normally and is unaffected by Stonekin layering. Material traits, resistances, weaknesses, and layer effects continue to apply without modification. This ruling exists to preserve Energymancy’s conservation rules without breaking the Stonekin layered durability system, and should be used with GM approval.
