If multiple effects grant the same type of bonus (for example, two spells that both increase AC), only the highest bonus applies unless an effect specifically states it can stack.

Bonuses from different types of sources (such as a spell and a rune) can stack, as long as neither effect explicitly overrides the other.

In practice, this means that natural armor and worn armor do not stack, two different AC-boosting spells do not stack, but a potion that raises AC and worn armor do stack.
