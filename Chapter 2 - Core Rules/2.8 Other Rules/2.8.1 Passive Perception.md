**What It Is**
Passive Perception is your character’s ability to notice hidden things without actively looking for them. It represents how alert or aware they are by default.

**How It’s Used**
The Game Master (GM) uses your Passive Perception to determine if you automatically notice things like:
- Hidden traps
- Sneaky enemies
- Subtle clues in the environment
You don’t roll for it, the GM just checks your score in the background. Your passive perception score is equal to 10 + Wisdom Modifier.
A higher Passive Perception means you’re more likely to notice danger before it’s too late, even when you’re not actively looking.
