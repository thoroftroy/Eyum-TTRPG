Inspiration is a special reward the GM can grant players for exceptional moments of roleplay, clever problem-solving, emotional depth, or creative actions that enhance the game.
The GM may award 1 point of Inspiration when a player:
- Deeply role plays their character’s beliefs, flaws, or background.
- Solves a puzzle or problem in an especially creative way.
- Enhances the group’s enjoyment through immersion or storytelling.
- Impresses the table with a cool, cinematic moment.

There is no limit to how many times you can earn Inspiration, it is tracked as a tally, not a binary on/off switch. You can hold multiple points at once unless the GM sets a limit.
Inspiration may be spent to gain advantage on any d20 roll, standard advantage rules apply. 
You must declare that you are using Inspiration before the result of the roll is revealed, but you do not have to declare it before you roll.
Once spent, the point(s) are consumed.
