Each character rolls initiative (1d20) at the start of combat. Your initiative bonus is:

Dexterity modifier + any bonuses from race, feats, class abilities, or items.

If two or more characters roll the same number then the one with the higher Dex score will go first. If they are still tied then those players must reroll their dice to see who will go first.
