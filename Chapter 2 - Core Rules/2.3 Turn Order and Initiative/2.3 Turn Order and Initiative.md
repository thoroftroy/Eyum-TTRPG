**What this covers.** 
Combat in The World of Eyum is resolved in **turns**. **Initiative** determines who acts first and in what sequence the rest of the combatants take their turns. You’ll roll once at the start of a fight, and that order governs the flow of play.
#### What initiative is (and why it matters)
Initiative is a simple ranking of all combatants from fastest to slowest for the encounter. High initiative lets you act sooner, move, attack, cast, before your opponents can respond. The GM records the results so everyone knows “who goes when,” and then the table proceeds in that order each round.
#### How initiative is calculated
At the start of combat, **each character rolls 1d20** and adds their **initiative bonus**:  
**Dexterity modifier + any bonuses from race, feats, class abilities, or items.**

**Ties:** If two or more characters roll the same number, the one with the **higher Dexterity score** goes first. If still tied, those characters **reroll** to determine who goes first.
#### Ambushes and the Surprise Round
If one side successfully **ambushes** the other, the **ambushing party always goes first**, ignoring normal initiative order for that initial exchange. Resolve a **surprise round** before regular initiative begins.
- During the **surprise round**, **all members of the ambushing party** take their turns **before** the actual initiative of the fight. If the ambushers then also win normal initiative, they can effectively take **two turns** before the unaware side acts (surprise round → first regular round).
- **Only creatures unaware** of the ambush are affected. If a creature is **immune to surprise** or **aware** of the ambush, it **acts during the surprise round like normal**.

After the surprise round, proceed into the standard initiative order for the rest of combat.
#### Delaying your turn
A character may **delay their turn**, moving themselves **to a lower position** in the initiative order **for the rest of the combat**. This must be declared **before taking any actions**. Once you choose to delay, your **new initiative position is permanent** for that encounter.
#### Organizing turns at the table
To keep combat readable, we recommend one of two ways to structure the sequence once initiative is set:
- **Grouped Initiative:** All **players act together**, then all **enemies act** (or vice versa). Use this for **speed and simplicity**, fewer hand-offs, quicker rounds.
- **Individual Initiative:** Every combatant acts strictly in **rolled order**. Use this for **tactical precision** and **dramatic tension**, this will take longer but is more realistic.
Both are valid; choose the one that fits your table’s pacing goals.
#### Quick flow reference (combat start to first round)
1. **Roll initiative** and establish the order. The GM records it.
2. If there’s a **successful ambush**, run the **surprise round** first (only against unaware targets as noted).
3. Proceed through **turns** using either **grouped** or **individual** initiative, per your table’s choice.
4. On your turn, take actions per the **turn economy** (AP/BAP/Movement; RP when triggered outside your turn).
