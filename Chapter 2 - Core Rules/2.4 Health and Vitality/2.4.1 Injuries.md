## When to check for an Injury
You only ever check when **HP** is actually harmed (Vitality hits don’t trigger injuries). Check **once per source** of HP damage (one attack/spell/trap), using the HP portion for mixed cases.  
**Triggers:**
1. **Single-target HP damage:** check. (Vitality must be 0 or the effect explicitly bypassed it.)
2. **AoE damage:** check using the **HP half** that bypassed Vitality.
3. **Critical hits:** always check (criticals **bypass Vitality**).
4. **Massive Damage:** if one hit deals **≥50% max HP**, you still apply the **Massive Damage Rule** normally; you also run a **Severe** injury check (below).

> **Note:** If the target is reduced to **0 HP**, they die; do not apply injuries.
## Step 1 — Determine Injury Severity (from that one source of HP damage)
Calculate **% of max HP lost from that single source** (round down any fractional HP when comparing to thresholds):

| Severity     | HP lost from a single source                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minor**    | **≥10%** and **<25%** of max HP                                   |
| **Moderate** | **≥25%** and **<50%** of max HP                                   |
| **Severe**   | **≥50%** of max HP (this also triggers Massive Damage separately) |
| **Extreme**  | **≥75%** of max HP (this also triggers Massive Damage separately) |
**Critical Hit upgrade:** after setting the band above, **upgrade** severity by **one step** (min **Moderate**, max **Extreme**). 
## Step 2 — Injury Save (CON)
Make a **Constitution saving throw** vs the DC for the severity:

| Severity | Injury Save (CON) DC |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Minor    | **DC 10**            |
| Moderate | **DC 15**            |
| Severe   | **DC 20**            |
| Extreme  | **DC 25**            |
- **Success:** no injury is applied.
- **Failure:** apply the conditions listed in the injury mapping table below.
- **Natural 1:** apply the conditions listed but increase their save DC's by 5 and increase the number of turns they last by 1.
- **Duplicate conditions:** do **not** stack numerically (e.g., Bleeding remains 1d4/turn); instead **refresh** or use the longer remaining duration per the condition’s own rules.

> This step relies solely on Conditions and their **existing** removal methods (Medicine, healing magic, time), so it remains fully rules-compliant.
## Step 3 Injury Mapping (by damage type → apply these Conditions on a failed Injury Save)
**Use the damage type of the source that dealt HP damage.** If a source explicitly inflicts a listed condition (such as **Necrosis** or **Hellfire**), apply that condition as written instead of the table’s default. Each condition includes an **x#** value indicating how many turns it lasts. Follow the individual condition’s rules for ending it early. Otherwise, the condition automatically ends at the end of its listed duration, regardless of any other timing or effects. If a DC is specified in this table it overwrites the condition table's standard DC. Conditions from injuries are applied **on top of** the standard conditions and checks from taking damage from that damage source. 

| Damage Type                           | Minor (DC 10)                  | Moderate (DC 15)                        | Severe (DC 20)                                  | Extreme (DC 25)                                              |

> **If a minor injury causes a condition, it cannot reduce your HP below 1.** When this happens, the condition automatically ends once your HP reaches that point. However, **moderate and severe injuries can still be fatal.**
