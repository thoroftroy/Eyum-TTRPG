## When to check for an Injury
You only ever check when **HP** is actually harmed (Vitality hits don’t trigger injuries). Check **once per source** of HP damage (one attack/spell/trap), using the HP portion for mixed cases.  
**Triggers:**
1. **Single-target HP damage:** check. (Vitality must be 0 or the effect explicitly bypassed it.)
2. **AoE damage:** check using the **HP half** that bypassed Vitality.
3. **Critical hits:** always check (criticals **bypass Vitality**).
4. **Massive Damage:** if one hit deals **≥50% max HP**, you still apply the **Massive Damage Rule** normally; you also run a **Severe** injury check (below).

> **Note:** If the target is reduced to **0 HP**, they die; do not apply injuries.
## Step 1 — Determine Injury Severity (from that one source of HP damage)
Calculate **% of max HP lost from that single source** (round down any fractional HP when comparing to thresholds):

|Severity|HP lost from a single source|
|---|---|
|**Minor**|**≥10%** and **<25%** of max HP|
|**Moderate**|**≥25%** and **<50%** of max HP|
|**Severe**|**≥50%** of max HP (this also triggers Massive Damage separately)|
**Critical Hit upgrade:** after setting the band above, **upgrade** severity by **one step** (min **Moderate**, max **Severe**). 
## Step 2 — Injury Save (CON)
Make a **Constitution saving throw** vs the DC for the severity:

| Severity | Injury Save (CON) DC |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Minor    | **DC 10**            |
| Moderate | **DC 12**            |
| Severe   | **DC 15**            |
- **Success:** no injury is applied.
- **Failure:** apply one condition from the **Injury Mapping** table (below) based on the **damage type** that harmed HP.
- **Natural 1:** apply **two** different conditions from that damage type’s row (if only one is listed, apply it and **refresh** its duration/rolls per that condition’s rules).
- **Duplicate conditions:** do **not** stack numerically (e.g., Bleeding remains 1d4/turn); instead **refresh** or use the longer remaining duration per the condition’s own rules.

> This step relies solely on Conditions and their **existing** removal methods (Medicine, healing magic, time), so it remains fully rules-compliant.
## Step 3 Injury Mapping (by damage type → apply these Conditions on a failed Injury Save)
Use the damage type of the HP-dealing source. If a source explicitly applies a listed condition (e.g., **Necrosis**, **Hellfire**), use that specific condition as written instead of the row’s default.

| Damage Type     | Minor (DC 10)                    | Moderate (DC 12)       | Severe (DC 15)            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Slashing**    | **Bleeding**                     | **Bleeding**           | **Bleeding + Stunned**    |
| **Piercing**    | **Bleeding**                     | **Bleeding**           | **Bleeding + Stunned**    |
| **Bludgeoning** | **Stunned (ends EoNT / CON 14)** | **Stunned**            | **Stunned + Deafened**    |
| **Fire**        | **Burned**                       | **Burned**             | **On Fire** **+ Burned**  |
| **Cold**        | **Frostbitten**                  | **Frostbitten**        | **Frostbitten + Stunned** |
| **Poison**      | **Poisoned**                     | **Poisoned**           | **Poisoned**              |
| **Psychic**     | **Demoralized**                  | **Confused**           | **Insane**                |
| **Thunder**     | **Stunned**                      | **Stunned + Deafened** | **Stunned + Deafened**    |
| **Force**       | **Stunned**                      | **Stunned**            | **Stunned**               |
| **Necrotic**    | **Necrosis**                     | **Necrosis**           | **Necrosis**              |
| **Radiant**     | **Blinded**                      | **Blinded**            | **Blinded**               |
If you receive a condition from a minor injury it cannot reduce your HP below 1. In this case the condition will simply end once your HP gets that low. Moderate and Severe injuries can kill you though.
