- Hit Points (HP): A player’s HP represents their physical health. At level 1, HP is calculated as one roll of their class’s hit die. If HP reaches 0, the character dies and cannot be revived at all*.
    

- HP is more difficult to recover and typically requires healing spells, potions, or extended rest.
    
- Hp should be thought of like death saving throws without randomness. It is a measure of your health, once you start taking damage you are dying and you need to get out. 
    

- Vitality: Vitality represents a character’s stamina and ability to avoid direct harm. It acts as a protective buffer before Health Points (HP), absorbing most damage from attacks.
    

- Vitality is easier to restore than HP and can be replenished through short rests, potions, or certain abilities.
    
- Most attacks reduce Vitality first, symbolizing dodges, deflections, or glancing blows. Once Vitality reaches 0, remaining damage is applied to HP.
    
- Area-of-effect attacks partially bypass Vitality. Unless otherwise stated, half of the damage from an AoE affects Vitality, and the other half is applied directly to HP.
    
- Vitality can be safely used as a resource without long-term consequences, unlike HP, which represents true injury. The GM may inflict more permanent consequences for taking HP damage such as losing an eye or a limb. 
    

*Characters normally die at 0 HP unless they have a feat or feature that overrides this, they also can occasionally be revived with powerful magic if acted on quickly enough.
