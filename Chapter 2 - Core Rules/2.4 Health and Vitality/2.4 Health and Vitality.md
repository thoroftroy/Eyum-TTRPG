#### What these two pools mean
**Hit Points (HP)** are your **actual health**. When HP hits **0**, you **die** (see exceptions below). HP is **harder to recover** and generally requires **healing magic, potions, or rest**. Think of HP like “death saves without the randomness”: once you’re taking HP damage, you are **actively dying** and should disengage or get healed.

**Vitality (Vit)** is your **stamina and evasive buffer**, it represents dodges, deflections, and near-misses. Most damage is taken from Vitality **first**; when Vitality reaches **0**, subsequent damage spills into **HP**. Vitality is **easier to restore** via rest, potions, or abilities, and the system treats it as a resource you can spend without long-term harm.

Generally Speaking all damage is reduced from the target’s Vitality first, and then Health if Vitality reaches 0.
#### How damage interacts with Vitality vs. HP
##### The normal case
- **Single-target** weapon/spell damage: reduce **Vitality** first, then **HP** if Vitality is at 0.
- After taking HP damage (not Vitality damage) you run the risk of injuries (see [[2.4.1 Injuries]])
##### Area-of-Effect (AoE)
- Unless a spell/ability **says otherwise**, **half** of the AoE’s damage **bypasses Vitality** and hits **HP directly**; the other half applies to **Vitality**.
##### Other ways damage can bypass Vitality
- **Sleeping/Unconscious target:** any successful hit is a **critical** and **bypasses Vitality**, applying full damage to **HP**.
- **Undodgeable/inescapable** situations (restrained, helpless, truly unaware): **bypass Vitality**; the **GM** judges whether the situation was genuinely unavoidable.
- **Critical hits** set all damage dice to their **maximum** before adding modifiers and **bypasses Vitality**.
#### Death and Revival (Read Carefully)
- At **0 HP**, a creature **dies instantly**.
- **Exceptions:**  
    • Some **feats/features** can override death at 0 HP.  
    • Some **spells/abilities** include a **revival window** (e.g., “revivable within 10 minutes”). If used in time, the creature can return.
- **Finality:** after **48 hours** dead, the soul is unreachable, **no** magic, ritual, or divine act can restore the creature.

> Practical note for parties: someone who can heal, or access resurrection-window magic, is strategically vital.
### Vitality/Hit/Mana Dice
Each class lists **three** dice progressions:
- **Vitality Dice** - increase your **maximum Vitality**.
- **Hit Dice** - increase your **maximum HP**.
- **Mana Dice** - increase your **maximum Mana**.

When a class lists something like **Vitality Dice: 2d10+1d12**, you **roll that full set** **each time you gain a level in that class** and add the total to your **maximum Vitality**. You **never** roll just one of those dice, you always roll the **full set** listed.
- **Example (from the Handbook):** A Fighter with **Vitality Dice: 2d12** rolls **two d12** every time they gain a Fighter level; add the total to **max Vitality**.
- **Mana Dice and your casting stat:** When you roll **Mana Dice** at level-up, add your **spellcasting modifier** (e.g., Charisma for a Warlock) to the result.

When rolling Vitality Dice you add your Constitution Modifier to the final roll.
When Rolling Hit Dice you add nothing.
When Rolling Mana Dice you add your Wisdom Modifier to the final roll.
### Massive Damage Rule
If you take **≥ 50% of your maximum HP** in **one hit**, make a **DC 10 Constitution save**:
- **Fail:** you are **unconscious** until the end of your **next turn** (or until you take damage again).
- **Succeed:** you **remain standing**, but take **-1** to all **attack rolls** **on your next turn**.
