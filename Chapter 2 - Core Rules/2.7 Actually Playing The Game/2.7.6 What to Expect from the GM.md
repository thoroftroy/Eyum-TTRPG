The GM is the narrator, referee, and world-builder. Their job is to describe scenes, play the roles of every NPC, and respond to player actions with logic, fairness, and creativity. The GM sets the tone and keeps things moving. Here’s how a GM might guide the game:

Scene Introduction

“You arrive at the gates of an overgrown fortress. Vines spill through the cracks, and the torches once lighting the path now hang cold and shattered.”

NPC Roleplay

(as the guard) “No one enters the town past midnight. Orders from the top. You don’t look like trouble… but rules are rules.”

Calling for a Roll

“You want to pick the lock? Alright, roll a d20 and add your Lockpicking skill.”

Combat Start

“As you turn the corner, a massive spider drops from the ceiling. Everyone, roll initiative!”

Describing Results

“With that high roll, you spot the glimmer of a pressure plate right before you step on it. You stop just in time.”

A good GM balances challenge and fun. They don’t need to know every rule, but they should be confident, fair, and willing to improvise. Their goal is to make the world feel real and give players the freedom to interact with it meaningfully.
