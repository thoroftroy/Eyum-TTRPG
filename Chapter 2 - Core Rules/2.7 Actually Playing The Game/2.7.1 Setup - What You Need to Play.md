You can play Eyum in two ways:

Option 1: Using Miniatures (Recommended)

To play with miniatures (physical representations of characters), you’ll need:

- A miniature or token for each character. This can be a real painted model, a LEGO figure, a pebble, or even a paper square with the character’s name on it. It just needs to be clearly identifiable.
    
- Additional miniatures or tokens for monsters, enemies, or NPCs controlled by the GM.
    
- A grid-based board or mat. A checkerboard, a dry erase board, or even graph paper works. Each square usually represents 5 feet. This makes it easy to measure movement and range during combat.
    
- Terrain markers. Use paper, blocks, or colors to show features like walls, pits, rivers, or obstacles. Example: Blue paper = water, black = pit, gray = wall.
    

Benefits: This method makes combat easier, shows distances and obstacles clearly, and helps with tactical decisions.

Option 2: Theater of the Mind (No Miniatures)

You don’t need any physical setup. Instead, the GM describes scenes out loud, and players imagine them.

- The GM might say: “You’re standing in a crumbling temple. There’s a large statue ahead and a hallway to your left.”
    
- Players then ask questions or state actions: “I walk to the statue and examine it.”
    
- Distances are kept abstract unless the GM decides otherwise (Generally during combat).
    

Benefits: Easier to set up, works well online, encourages imagination. However, it's harder to track complex combat without a grid. (Note: if you do it online you can always share your screen and make everything in photoshop and simply move around the characters images)
