You can run Eyum with physical pieces on a grid **or** purely in your imagination. Both are valid—pick the one that fits your group.
#### Option 1: Using Miniatures (Recommended)
You’ll need:
- A **miniature or token for each character** (painted model, LEGO, coin, paper square, anything clearly identifiable).
- **Extra tokens** for monsters/NPCs (GM’s side).
- A **grid board or mat**; each square usually represents **5 feet**, great for measuring distance and ranges.
- **Terrain markers** (paper/blocks/colors) to show walls, pits, rivers, etc. Example: blue = water, black = pit, gray = wall.

**Why use minis?** Clear distances and obstacles make tactical choices easier and faster.
#### Option 2: Theater of the Mind (No Miniatures)
No board required. The GM describes the scene and you visualize it:
- GM example: “You’re in a crumbling temple; a large statue ahead, a hallway left.”
- Player example: “I walk to the statue and examine it.”

**Distances stay abstract** unless the GM decides otherwise (often in combat).  
**Trade-off:** Easy to set up and great online, but complex combats are harder to track without a grid (screen-share maps can help).


#### Bring these to each session:
- **Character sheet** (printed or digital)
- **Dice set** (or app)
- **Pencil/notes**
- **Mini or token** (if using minis)
