Combat in Eyum is turn-based and follows specific steps:

1. Roll Initiative

When a fight starts, everyone rolls a d20 to determine the turn order. Add your Initiative bonus (based on Dexterity). The GM keeps track of who goes when.

2. Your Turn

On your turn, you can do several things, depending on your Action Points (AP), Bonus Action Points (BAP), and Reaction Points (RP). Most characters start with 1 of each.

On your turn, you may:

- Move up to your Speed (e.g., 30 feet = 6 squares)
    
- Take an Action (e.g., attack, cast a spell, dash)
    
- Take a Bonus Action, if you have one available
    
- Use Free Actions (talking, dropping items, etc.)
    

Combat uses the grid or verbal descriptions to determine range and positioning. You can attack enemies, cast spells, dodge, help allies, hide, or interact with the environment.

3. Reactions and Interrupts

Outside of your turn, you can use Reactions (like opportunity attacks) if something triggers them. These allow you to act when it’s not your turn, but only under specific conditions.

4. GM Controls Enemies

The GM describes how monsters behave and rolls for them. They use their own stats and abilities and follow similar rules to players.

Combat Example

Let’s say you’re fighting a group of wolves. The scene might play out like this:

1. GM: “Three wolves snarl at you from the treeline. Roll initiative.”
    
2. You: “I roll a 14.”
    
3. On your turn:
    

- You move 10 feet to get within range.
    
- You attack with your axe (roll a d20 + your Strength and attack bonus).
    
- You hit and roll for damage (based on your weapon).
    
- You end your turn.
    

5. The GM describes how the wolves respond, then the next player goes.
