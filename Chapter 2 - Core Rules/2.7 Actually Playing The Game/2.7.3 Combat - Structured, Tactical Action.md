When blades come out (or spells fly), Eyum switches to a turn structure so everyone gets a clear chance to act.
#### Step 1: Roll Initiative
Everyone rolls **1d20 + initiative bonus (Dex-based)** to set turn order. The GM tracks who goes when.
#### Step 2: Your Turn
Each turn you act using your **Action Points (AP)**, **Bonus Action Points (BAP)**, and **Reaction Points (RP)**. **Most characters start with 1 of each** On your turn, you can:
- **Move** up to your Speed (e.g., 30 ft = 6 squares)
- **Take an Action** (attack, cast a spell, dash, etc.)
- **Take a Bonus Action** (if available)
- **Use Free Actions** (talk, drop items, simple interactions)

Range/position come from the grid or the GM’s description; you can attack, cast, dodge, help, hide, or interact with the environment.
#### Step 3: Reactions and Interrupts
Even outside your turn, you may act **if triggered** (e.g., opportunity attacks), but only under those specific conditions.
#### Step 4: GM Controls Enemies
The GM runs monsters with their own stats/abilities using the same core rules.
##### Quick Example (Wolves)
- GM: “Three wolves snarl from the treeline, **roll initiative**.”
- You: “I roll **14**.”
- On your turn: move 10 ft, attack with your axe (roll d20 + STR + attack bonus), roll damage, end turn.
- GM describes the wolves’ response; next player goes.
