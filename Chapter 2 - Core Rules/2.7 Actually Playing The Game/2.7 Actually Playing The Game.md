> **Read this first:** This section is meant to be read after you’ve created your character and gone through most of the core rules. If your GM asked you to start here instead, that’s fine, just know this section assumes you already understand basics like dice rolls, stats, and actions. If anything here doesn’t make sense, start at the beginning or ask your GM for help.

**What this section does:** It shows you what actually happens at the table, from setup to moment-to-moment play, to how combat is structured, to what a “typical session” feels like. New to TTRPGs? You’re in the right place
