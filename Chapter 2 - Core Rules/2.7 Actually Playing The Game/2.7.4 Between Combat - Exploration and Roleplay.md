Most of the game is not combat. You’ll explore towns, investigate ruins, talk to NPCs, solve puzzles, and make decisions that shape the story.

You can:

- Buy and sell items
    
- Take on quests
    
- Rest and recover
    
- Roleplay your character’s beliefs, flaws, and motivations
    
- Interact with other players and NPCs
    
- Track time and resources (if your GM includes survival elements)
