Eyum proceeds as a conversation, punctuated by rolls **only when outcomes are uncertain**.
#### 1) The GM Describes a Scene
They open with what you see and hear (peaceful town, dark forest, trapped corridor, etc.). Example: “A dim tavern, air thick with ale and smoke; a hooded figure sits alone”.
#### 2) Players React
You say what your character attempts: talk to an NPC, search, investigate, prepare for trouble, ask clarifying questions.  
Play in-character: bold? Approach the hooded figure. Cautious? Watch from shadows.
#### 3) The GM Resolves Actions
- **Trivial actions** (“I cross the room”) just happen.
- **Risky/uncertain actions** call for a roll (usually d20): add relevant modifiers; compare to a **DC** the GM uses to judge difficulty.  
    _Example:_ “I sneak past the guards” → “Roll **Stealth**” → GM compares your total vs. the guards’ passive perception, then narrates success or failure.
