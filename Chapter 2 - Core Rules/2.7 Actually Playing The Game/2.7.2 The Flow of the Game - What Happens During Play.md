1. The GM Describes a Scene

Each “scene” or “moment” in the story begins with the GM describing what the characters see, hear, or feel. This might be a peaceful town, a dark forest, or a trap-filled dungeon.

Example:

“You enter a dimly lit tavern. The smell of ale and smoke fills the air. A hooded man is sitting alone in the corner.”

2. The Players React

Each player describes what their character wants to do. You might:

- Talk to an NPC
    
- Search for clues
    
- Investigate an object
    
- Prepare for battle
    
- Ask the GM clarifying questions
    

You are playing as your character. So if your character is curious and bold, you might say, “I approach the hooded man and ask him what he’s doing here.” If your character is cautious, you might instead say, “I stay back and watch from the shadows.”

3. The GM Resolves Actions

- If your action is simple and has no chance of failure (like “I walk across the room”), it just happens.
    
- If there’s risk or uncertainty, the GM asks for a roll (usually a d20). You’ll roll the die, add any relevant modifiers (like a skill or stat), and compare it to a target number (the Difficulty Class or DC).
    

Example:

You say, “I want to sneak past the guards.”  
The GM says, “Roll Stealth.”  
You roll a d20 and add your Stealth bonus. The GM compares that to the guards’ passive perception.

Success or failure depends on your total result. The GM describes the outcome.
