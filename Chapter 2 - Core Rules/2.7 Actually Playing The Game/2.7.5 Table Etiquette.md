#### Core principles for everyone
- **Share the load of keeping the game focused and moving.** Whether it’s combat, exploration, or roleplay, every player helps the session stay on track and meaningful.
- **Be present even off your turn.** You may be called on for a reaction, save, or quick decision during someone else’s move, don’t zone out. Put phones away and keep one ear on the scene.
- **Let mechanics and narrative support each other.** Roleplay doesn’t replace rolls; use your stats and skills when the GM calls for them.
- **Respect the spotlight.** Don’t dominate scenes; ensure quieter players get time. Rotate focus so everyone shines.
#### Player etiquette
- **On your turn: be ready and decisive.** Know your abilities, track your resources, and act with intent when your name is called.
- **Off your turn: stay engaged.** Track initiative, plan your next move, watch for combo setups, and be ready to use reactions.
- **Support others’ moments.** If you’ve had the spotlight for a while, wrap and pass it on; when someone else is center stage, enhance their scene with short, in-character responses.
- **Don’t metagame.** Keep player knowledge separate from character knowledge; let the world surprise you.
- **Ask when unsure.** Quick, respectful questions keep play smooth; the GM will help and you don’t need every rule memorized.
- **Mind the table’s tone.** Session Zero sets expectations for content and style, play to that agreement.
#### GM etiquette*
- **Facilitate fairly and consistently.** Use the Handbook as a framework, keep rulings explainable, and maintain consistency to protect immersion.
- **Listen and share spotlight.** Draw quieter players in and keep one player from dominating.
- **Keep play moving.** If a rule is unclear, make a **temporary ruling** now and finalize later; don’t change rules mid-combat unless it’s an emergency fix everyone agrees to.
- **Challenge, don’t punish.** Reward exploration and creativity; never retaliate or “win” against your players.
- **Describe like a camera.** Focus on what players would notice; avoid monologues that stall play.
- **Encourage collaboration and stay flexible.** Build situations where different play-styles rely on each other; listen and adapt as interests change.
#### Handling disagreements (without derailing the game)
- **Don’t argue mid-scene.** Keep the story moving; rules can be clarified later.
- **Use a quick ruling, then revisit.** GMs should make a provisional call and continue; finalize the detail after the encounter or session.
- **Escalate respectfully after the session.** If something still feels wrong, discuss it calmly outside the heat of play. In-game disputes stay in character; out-of-game friction is handled with clarity and care.
- **Remember roles.** The GM is guide and referee, trust that they’re aiming for fairness and momentum.
#### What to do when it isn’t your turn
- **Track the order and the scene.** Keep initiative in mind and follow the evolving fiction so you can respond instantly when prompted.
- **Prep your next move.** Know your options and resources (HP/Vitality, spells, items). Coordinate with allies for setups and defenses.
- **Stay off your phone and in the world.** Distractions make you miss triggers and slow the table down.
#### In General
- **Let others speak and take their turns.** Share spotlight and rotate focus so everyone has moments to shine.
- **Don’t argue with the GM; clarify later.** Use temporary rulings to keep pace; revisit after.
- **Stay in character; save distractions for breaks.** Immersion and focus make sessions smoother and more fun.
- **Help, don’t hijack.** Remind each other of abilities, but don’t take over someone else’s choices.
