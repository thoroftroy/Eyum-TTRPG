Characters interact with the world based on what they can see, and in Eyum, not everyone sees the same way. Some races thrive in pitch darkness; others need light to survive underground. This section explains how light and vision work in the game world.

#### Light Levels

| Light Level  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bright Light | Full visibility. Daylight, torches within 20 ft, glowing crystals, etc. No penalties.                                                                                                               |
| Dim Light    | Partial visibility. Shadows, twilight, or the edge of torchlight (20-40 ft). Creatures may gain concealment (+3 to AC) unless you have Low-Light or Darkvision. Disadvantage on Search/Spot Checks. |
| Darkness     | No natural visibility. Caves, night with no moon, deep dungeons. You cannot see without Darkvision, magic, or a light source. Double disadvantage on attack rolls and Search/Spot Checks            |
#### Types of Vision

| Type             | Range           | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal Vision    | N/A             | You see clearly in bright light and dimly in dim light. You cannot see in darkness without a light source.                                                        |
| Low-Light Vision | N/A             | You treat dim light as bright light for visibility. You still cannot see in complete darkness.                                                                    |
| Darkvision       | 60 ft (default) | You can see in total darkness as if it were dim light, but only in shades of gray. You cannot discern color.                                                      |
| True Sight       | Varies          | You see everything as it truly is: invisible creatures, hidden illusions, ethereal forms, and magical darkness. Only obtained through magic or special abilities. |
#### Light Sources

| Source        | Bright Light     | Dim Light |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Torch         | 20 ft            | 20 ft     |
| Lantern       | 30 ft            | 30 ft     |
| Light (spell) | 30 ft            | 30 ft     |
| Campfire      | 40 ft            | 40 ft     |
#### Notes:
- Torches burn for 1 hour. You can carry one in a free hand.
- Lanterns require oil and must be lit, they last for 5 hours.
#### Darkvision Rules
- Most underground, shadow-aligned, or nocturnal races have Darkvision (60 ft) by default. A few powerful creatures may have 120 ft.
- Darkvision does not pierce magical darkness. It also renders everything in gray-scale, making color identification impossible.
- If you have Darkvision, you ignore darkness penalties within range.
- If you do not have it, you are effectively blind in total darkness.
#### Other Rules
- Stealth in Dim Light: Characters in dim light may gain +2 to Stealth checks if their opponents lack Low-Light or Darkvision.
- Darkness as Terrain: Unless the creature has a means to see Total Darkness always counts as Difficult Terrain (see **Section 2.1.6 Movement and Terrain**)
