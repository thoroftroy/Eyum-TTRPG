When rolling a d20 for an action check, a character's success or failure is not always a simple pass/fail. Instead, there are multiple degrees of success that determine how well the action was performed:

- Critical Fail (Roll = Natural 1): The action fails in the worst way possible, always with a major negative consequence. 
    
- Failure (Roll < DC): The action fails, producing no positive effect. If the roll is 5 or more below the DC, the failure is exceptionally bad, meaning the GM may introduce additional consequences.
    
- Success (Roll ≥ DC): The action is successful, producing the intended effect.
    
- Great Success (Roll ≥ DC +5): The action is completed exceptionally well, potentially adding extra benefits at the GM's discretion.
    
- Critical Success (Roll = Natural 20 or Roll ≥ DC +10): The action is executed flawlessly, often with additional bonuses or a major advantage granted by the GM.
    

Example Applications

- Jumping a gap (DC 12)
    

- Roll 9: The character fails and falls.
    
- Roll 12: The character barely makes it across.
    
- Roll 17: The character clears the gap with ease.
    
- Roll 22: The character lands smoothly and could even take an extra step forward.
    

- Persuading a Guard (DC 15)
    

- Roll 10: The guard does not believe you.
    
- Roll 15: The guard lets you through reluctantly.
    
- Roll 20: The guard trusts you and offers information.
    
- Roll 25: The guard gives you access and suggests a safer route.
    

#### 2.1.4 Ties in Rolls

- If a roll exactly meets the DC, it is considered a success.
    
- In contested rolls, if both sides roll the same total result, the tie is broken by:
    

- The participant with the higher relevant attribute modifier winning.
    
- If still tied, a reroll may take place.
    

#### 2.1.5 Stacking Effects

- If multiple effects grant the same type of bonus (for example, two spells that both increase AC), only the highest bonus applies unless an effect specifically states it can stack.
    
- Bonuses from different types of sources (such as a spell and a rune) can stack, as long as neither effect explicitly overrides the other.
    
- In practice, this means that natural armor and worn armor do not stack, two different AC-boosting spells do not stack, but a potion that raises AC and worn armor do stack.
