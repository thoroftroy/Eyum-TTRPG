###### Movement Basics
On your turn, you can move up to your Speed in feet. Movement can be split around actions (e.g., move 15 ft, attack, then move another 15 ft). You may move through allies' spaces, but not through enemy spaces unless a rule/spell allows it (More detailed blow).
###### Climbing
- Climbing costs double movement unless stated otherwise.
- Example: Climbing 10 feet uses 20 feet of movement.
- If a surface is especially slick or sheer, the GM may require an Athletics check to climb successfully.
- Characters with climbing gear, claws, or spider-like limbs may ignore or reduce movement penalties.
###### Swimming
- Swimming also costs double movement unless the creature has a swim speed.
- Characters may be required to make an Athletics check in rough waters, strong currents, or while swimming in armor.
- Heavy armor imposes disadvantage on swim checks unless you have a swim speed.
###### Flying
- Creatures with a fly speed use it normally while airborne.
- Flying creatures must remain in motion unless hovering (specified by the thing that gives you flight). If they are knocked prone or restrained, they usually fall.
- The GM may call for checks (e.g., DEX saves) to avoid crashing in bad weather or tight spaces.

Note: Characters cannot fly without magic, a spell, a mount, or a natural fly speed.
###### Difficult Terrain
Difficult terrain represents cluttered, hazardous, or unstable ground, such as mud, rubble, deep snow, or dense forest.
- Moving through difficult terrain costs double movement.
- Example: 10 ft of difficult terrain uses 20 ft of movement.
- Some abilities or spells allow you to ignore difficult terrain.

Note: Difficult terrain does not stack, you either treat a space as difficult or not.
###### Cover
Cover offers protection from ranged attacks, spells, or other effects that require line of sight. A creature behind cover is harder to hit.

There are three types of cover:

| Type of Cover  | Bonus                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Half Cover     | +2 to AC and Advantage on DEX saves |
| Three-Quarters | +5 to AC and Advantage DEX saves    |
| Total Cover    | Cannot be targeted directly         |
###### High Ground
If a creature has **high ground** (is at least 1 foot above the head of another creature) it will have advantage on attack rolls against creatures lower than it and creatures beneath it will have disadvantages on attacks made against them. This can by bypassed with specific skills and feats but applies to all attacks made within range. 
###### Flanking
When you attack a creature from behind while an ally is engaging it from the front, you gain advantage on your attack roll. Additionally, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against your effects during this time.
###### Opportunity Attacks
Moving through an enemyâ€™s reach provokes an opportunity attack. When this occurs, the enemy may use their Reaction (**See 2.2 Core Actions**) to make a melee attack against you as you pass. This rule applies to all creatures unless a feat, spell, or ability states otherwise. In order to do an opportunity attack you must be wielding a melee weapon. This attack interrupts their movement but does not stop it unless a separate effect applies such as knocking them prone.

For example:
- If a monster moves past you, you may make an opportunity attack and vice versa.

However, If you move past a monster while invisible or after taking the Disengage action (**See 2.2 Core Actions**), you do not provoke opportunity attacks.
