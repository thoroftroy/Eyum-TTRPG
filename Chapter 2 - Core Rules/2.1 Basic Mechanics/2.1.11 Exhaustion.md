Exhaustion represents a character's declining condition due to overexertion, starvation, lack of rest, or certain magical effects.

Exhaustion is tracked in levels from 1 to 6, with each level imposing increasingly severe penalties:

| Exhaustion Level | Effect                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1                | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
| 2                | Speed halved                                   |
| 3                | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4                | HP and Vitality max reduced by 50%             |
| 5                | Speed reduced to 5ft                           |
| 6                | Death                                          |

**Note**: These penalties are cumulative. A character with level 3 exhaustion suffers the effects of levels 1, 2, and 3 simultaneously.
###### Causes of Exhaustion
- Going without food, water, or sleep for extended periods of time
- Traveling for more than 8 hours without rest
- Failing certain saving throws (e.g., extreme environments or spell/potion effects)
###### Removing Exhaustion
- Long Rest: Removes **1** level of exhaustion.
- Magical Means: Some spells can remove exhaustion instantly.
