Mounting allows characters to ride creatures such as horses, wyverns, or summoned beasts. It enhances speed, mobility, and certain combat options.

  

Mounts must be at least one size category larger than the rider.

Mounting and Dismounting

- Mount/Dismount costs 1 Action Point or half your movement (playerâ€™s choice).
    
- You must be adjacent to the mount and the creature must be willing or controlled.
    

###### Mounted Movement and Turn Order

- The mount and rider share a turn.
    
- The mount acts on the rider's initiative.
    
- You may direct the mount to move using free action commands (if trained).
    
- If the mount is not trained, it may act unpredictably or require an Animal Handling check (DC 12-20, GM discretion).
    

###### Attacking While Mounted

- The rider can attack as normal.
    
- Melee attacks from above gain advantage if the rider is using a reach weapon or the mount is 2+ sizes larger than the target.
    
- Ranged attacks made while moving at full speed are made with disadvantage, unless the rider has a relevant feat.
    

###### Mount Stats

- A typical mount uses its own HP, AC, and saves.
    
- If a mount takes more than half its max HP in one hit, it must make a DC 15 Constitution save or become panicked (must use Dash to flee next turn).
    
- If the mount dies or falls prone, the rider must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity save or fall prone and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
