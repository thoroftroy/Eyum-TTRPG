Some effects allow you to reroll dice or add extra dice to a roll. Here’s how these mechanics work:

Rerolls (e.g., Advantage, Luck)

When you are allowed to reroll a die (such as with advantage or a trait like Lucky), roll multiple dice and use only the highest single result (for advantage) or the lowest (for disadvantage):

- Advantage: Roll two d20s, take the higher result.
    
- Disadvantage: Roll two d20s, take the lower result.
    

You may not choose to ignore a reroll once made.

If an effect adds extra dice to a roll (such as damage dice or healing), roll those dice separately and add them to the final result. They do not replace the original roll or interact with advantage/disadvantage.

If you have multiple sources of advantage or disadvantage, they interact as follows:

- Each instance of advantage or disadvantage adds one “point” in that direction.
    
- They cancel each other out one for one.
    

Example: If you have 3 sources of advantage and 2 sources of disadvantage, you roll with 1 net advantage.

- If your final total is:
    

- 1+ Advantage: Roll multiple d20s equal to your remaining advantage (up to 3 max), and take the highest.
    
- 1+ Disadvantage: Roll multiple d20s equal to your remaining disadvantage (up to 3 max), and take the lowest.
    
- 0 (Neutral): Roll 1d20 as normal.
    

This system allows Double or Triple Advantage/Disadvantage to have mechanical meaning while remaining balanced.

Note: You can never roll more than 3 dice for a single advantage/disadvantage roll, even if you have more stacked. Any excess is ignored.
