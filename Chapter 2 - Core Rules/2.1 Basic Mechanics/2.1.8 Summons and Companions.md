Summoned creatures, pets, animal companions, and bonded allies are common in Eyum. Whether conjured by spell, tamed in the wild, or earned through questlines, these entities share a special bond with their summoner and follow simplified rules to keep gameplay fast and tactical.

This section defines how companions and summons function in combat, travel, and downtime.

###### Types of Companions

| Type              | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Summoned Creature | Temporarily created via spell, rune, or magic item. Lasts for a set duration or until dismissed/destroyed.                    |
| Tamed Companion   | Beast, construct, or magical creature bonded through a class feature (e.g., Druid), taming, or story event.                   |
| Narrative Ally    | NPC ally that travels with the party but is not directly controlled (e.g., soldier squad, deity emissary). GMs may run these. |
##### Action Economy
- Companions and summons act on your initiative (See [[2.3 Turn Order and Initiative]]).
- Tamed Companions:
	- You may command your companion as a Free Action on your turn.
	- It has 1 AP, 1 BAP, and 0 RP by default.
	- You may spend your own RP to give it a reaction once per round.
- Summons (magical):
	- You may direct their actions as part of the spell.
	- They automatically take their full turn unless Concentration ends or the summon is destroyed.
###### Control Limits
- You may only control 1 companion or 1 summon at a time per (total level / 3 [minimum of 1]) unless stated otherwise.
- Familiars, pets, and utility summons will not take actions in combat unless explicitly commanded.
###### Death
- If a summon or companion is reduced to 0 HP:
- Summons vanish instantly.
- Tamed companions die permanently unless they are revived just like a character (See [[2.4 Health and Vitality]])
##### Command Options
As a Free Action, you may issue one of the following commands per turn:

| Command | Effect                                                                     |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attack  | Target a visible enemy within range.                                       |
| Defend  | Guard an ally within 5 ft. Grants +2 AC to that ally until your next turn. |
| Stay    | Remain in place and take the Dodge action.                                 |
| Follow  | Move with you and take the Dash action if needed.                          |

 Note: If the Summon or Companion does not have an explicit attack they will make an improvised weapon attack.
