When an attack hits, you must calculate the total damage dealt. Damage is determined differently depending on whether it is a weapon attack or a spell, but all damage is reduced from the target’s Vitality first, and then Health if Vitality reaches 0.

  

Health and Vitality will be explained in detail in a later section. For now, understand that Vitality represents your stamina and energy. Losing Vitality indicates the effort it takes to avoid or mitigate attacks. Health (HP) represents your actual life force. Taking Health damage is far more dangerous, as it reflects real injury rather than spent energy.

Weapon Damage

To calculate damage from a melee or ranged weapon:

Damage = Weapon’s Damage Dice + Relevant Stat Modifier (Strength or Dexterity) + Base Damage

- Generally you would use your Strength mod if you are a Fighter, Barbarian, Paladin, or Strength based Monk
    

- Strength is used for raw force-based attacks (e.g., swinging a hammer or bashing with a shield).
    

- Generally you would use your Dexterity mod if you are a ranger, rouge, or Dexterity based Monk
    

- Dexterity is used when precision is the goal (e.g., aiming for a weak spot or throwing a knife).
    

- Your Base Damage increases primarily through your class, and sometimes through racial traits or other features. Base Damage is divided into three categories: Melee, Ranged, and Magic. When making an attack, use the Base Damage modifier that corresponds to the type of attack (melee, ranged, or magic) being used.
    

Examples:

- A sword that deals 1d8 damage, swung with a Strength modifier of +3 = 1d8 + 3 damage.
    
- A dagger thrown with a Dexterity modifier of +2 and a +1 damage bonus from enchantment = 1d4 + 2 + 1 damage.
    

Spell Damage

To calculate damage from a spell:

Damage = Spell’s Base Damage Dice (In the spell description) + Base Damage

Area-of-Effect (AoE) Damage

When using an AoE spell or ability:

- Half of the damage bypasses Vitality and hits HP directly unless otherwise stated in the spell description.
    

Other Ways to Bypass Vitality

While most damage is applied to Vitality first, certain situations allow damage to bypass Vitality and affect HP directly.

These include:

- Crits (Nat 20):
    

- A crit will always bypass Vitality and go directly to HP.
    

- Attacking a Sleeping or Unconscious Creature:
    

- Any successful attack against a creature that is asleep or unconscious is treated as a critical hit and bypasses Vitality, applying full damage directly to HP.
    

- Undodgeable or Inescapable Damage:
    

- If a creature is struck in a situation where evasion is physically impossible, such as being restrained, unaware, or helpless, then Vitality is bypassed.  
    The Game Master (GM) determines whether an attack qualifies as truly unavoidable.
    

Critical Hits

When you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, you score a critical hit. All damage dice are treated as their maximum possible result. Then, add all relevant modifiers as normal.

This applies to:

- Weapon attacks (melee or ranged)
    
- Spell attacks
    
- Class features or abilities that use damage dice
    

Examples:

- A sword that deals 1d8 + 4 on hit would deal 8 + 4 = 12 damage on a crit.
    
- A fire spell that deals 3d10 + 6 would deal 30 + 6 = 36 damage on a crit.
    

Note: Some abilities, weapons, or spells may still have their own critical hit enhancements. These are applied in addition to the max-damage rule unless stated otherwise.
