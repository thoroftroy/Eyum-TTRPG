Modifiers are the bonuses (or penalties) you add to dice rolls based on your character's core attributes. For example, if you have a Strength of 16, you have a +3 Strength modifier, which applies to actions like Athletics or melee attacks that use Strength.

Proficiency means you're trained in a particular skill, weapon, or type of gear. When you're proficient in something, you add your proficiency bonus to your roll. The bonus starts at somewhere around 1-3 (determined by your class) and increases as you level up (usually every few levels based on your class).

- If you're proficient in a skill (like Stealth or Arcana), you add both your attribute modifier and your proficiency bonus to that skill check.
    
- If you're proficient in a weapon, you can add your Strength or Dexterity modifier (depending on the weapon) to your attack rolls. Without proficiency, you can’t add that modifier and you can't use special effects or magic from the item.
    

- You never add your proficiency bonus to an attack roll, proficiency with a weapon only allows you to add your Strength or Dexterity modifier when you normally would not. 
    

- If you're proficient in a type of armor, you gain its full defensive benefits. If you're not proficient, you suffer penalties and may not be allowed to use it.
    

Expertise means you are exceptionally skilled at something. In Eyum, this grants advantage on related rolls, meaning you roll twice and take the higher result. Expertise typically applies to weapons, tools, or specific skills you've mastered. Some class features or feats allow you to upgrade proficiency into expertise. For example, if you have proficiency with a weapon attack then you would be able to add your Dexterity mod or Strength mod as well as having advantage on the roll.
