Summoned creatures, pets, animal companions, and bonded allies are common in Eyum. Whether conjured by spell, tamed in the wild, or earned through questlines, these entities share a special bond with their summoner and follow simplified rules to keep gameplay fast and tactical.

This section defines how companions and summons function in combat, travel, and downtime.

Types of Companions

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Type|Description|
|Summoned Creature|Temporarily created via spell, rune, or magic item. Lasts for a set duration or until dismissed/destroyed.|
|Tamed Companion|Beast, construct, or magical creature bonded through a class feature (e.g., Druid), taming, or story event.|
|Narrative Ally|NPC ally that travels with the party but is not directly controlled (e.g., soldier squad, deity emissary). GMs may run these.|

Stat Scaling Rules

All summoned or companion creatures use the following stat formula unless the summoning/taming ability says otherwise.

##### Action Economy

- Companions and summons act on your initiative.
    
- Tamed Companions:
    

- You may command your companion as a Free Action on your turn.
    
- It has 1 AP, 1 BAP, and 0 RP by default.
    
- You may spend your own RP to give it a reaction once per round.
    

- Summons (magical):
    

- You may direct their actions as part of the spell.
    
- They automatically take their full turn unless Concentration ends or the summon is destroyed.
    

Control Limits

- You may only control 1 companion or 1 summon at a time per (total level / 3 [minimum of 1]) unless stated otherwise.
    
- Attempting to control more companions without feats or class features causes the extra creature(s) to behave unpredictably or do nothing (GM discretion).
    
- Familiars, pets, and utility summons may not take actions in combat unless explicitly granted combat abilities.
    

Death

- If a summon or companion is reduced to 0 HP:
    

- Summons vanish instantly.
    
- Tamed companions die permanently unless they are revived just like a character
