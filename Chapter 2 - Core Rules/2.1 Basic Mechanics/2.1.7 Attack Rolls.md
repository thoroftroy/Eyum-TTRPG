When making an attack, whether melee, ranged, or magical, you must roll an attack roll, which is compared to the target’s Armor Class (AC). If your total attack roll equals or exceeds their AC, the attack hits.

  

How to Calculate an Attack Roll (add all points together):

Melee or Ranged Attack:

- Strength or Dexterity Modifier
    

- You do not add this bonus if you are not proficient with the weapon
    
- Strength Modifier is used when making general melee attacks (e.g., swinging a sword or hammer).
    
- Dexterity Modifier is used when you're targeting a specific spot (e.g., aiming for a weak point) or using a ranged attack.
    
- The modifier you use is not based on the weapon unless the weapon itself specifies which modifier you should use. 
    

- Base Accuracy is determined by your class.
    
- Weapon Accuracy is listed in the weapon's description (e.g., “+3 to hit”).
    
- Other Modifiers may come from feats, spells, conditions, etc.
    

Magical Attack:

- Affinity Modifier from the Spell's Type
    
- Generic Affinity Modifier
    
- Spellcasting Modifier (based on your class: Int, Wis, or Cha)
