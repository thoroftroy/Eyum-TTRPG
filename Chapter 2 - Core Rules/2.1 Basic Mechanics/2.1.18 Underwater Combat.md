Combat underwater functions differently due to resistance, visibility, and breathing limits. The following rules apply while fighting in submerged environments:

Movement:

- Creatures without a swim speed move at half their standard speed underwater.
    
- Wearing medium or heavy armor imposes disadvantage on swim checks.
    
- Dash and Disengage actions work normally, but terrain is always treated as difficult unless you have a swim speed.
    

Breathing:

- Characters without water-breathing abilities can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 1 + their Constitution modifier (minimum 1).
    
- After that, they begin suffocating (see 2.5.1 Conditions → Suffocating).
    

Attacks:

- Melee weapon attacks are made at disadvantage unless the weapon is:
    

- A dagger, spear, trident, or shortsword
    
- Or otherwise specifically adapted for underwater use (at GM discretion)
    

- Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss beyond their first range increment, and are made at disadvantage even within that range unless the weapon is thrown (e.g., javelin or dagger).
    
- Spells with verbal components cannot be cast unless the caster can breathe underwater or uses magic to bypass the requirement.
    
- Area-of-effect spells behave normally unless otherwise limited by the environment (e.g., fire-based spells may not work or deal reduced damage, this will happen at the GM’s discretion).
    

Visibility:

- Underwater vision is limited to 60 ft in clear water, or 30 ft in murky water.
    
- Darkvision works normally in water but does not improve clarity.
    
- Light-based spells only illuminate half their normal radius underwater unless specified otherwise.
