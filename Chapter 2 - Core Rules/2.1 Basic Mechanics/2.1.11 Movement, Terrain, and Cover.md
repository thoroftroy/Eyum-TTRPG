Movement Basics

On your turn, you can move up to your Speed in feet. Movement can be split around actions (e.g., move 15 ft, attack, then move another 15 ft). You may move through allies' spaces, but not through enemy spaces unless a rule/spell allows it.

Moving through an enemyâ€™s reach provokes an opportunity attack. When this occurs, the enemy may use their Reaction to make a melee attack against you as you pass. This rule applies to all creatures unless a feat, spell, or ability states otherwise.  
For example:

- If a monster moves past you, you may make an opportunity attack and vice versa.
    
- If you move past a monster while invisible or after taking the Disengage action, you do not provoke opportunity attacks.
    

Climbing

- Climbing costs double movement unless stated otherwise.
    

- Example: Climbing 10 feet uses 20 feet of movement.
    

- If a surface is especially slick or sheer, the GM may require an Athletics check to climb successfully.
    
- Characters with climbing gear, claws, or spider-like limbs may ignore or reduce movement penalties.
    

Swimming

- Swimming also costs double movement unless the creature has a swim speed.
    
- Characters may be required to make an Athletics check in rough waters, strong currents, or while swimming in armor.
    
- Heavy armor imposes disadvantage on swim checks unless you have a swim speed.
    

Flying

- Creatures with a fly speed use it normally while airborne.
    
- Flying creatures must remain in motion unless hovering (specified by the thing that gives you flight). If they are knocked prone or restrained, they usually fall.
    
- The GM may call for checks (e.g., DEX saves) to avoid crashing in bad weather or tight spaces.
    

Note: Characters cannot fly without magic, a spell, a mount, or a natural fly speed.

Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain represents cluttered, hazardous, or unstable ground, such as mud, rubble, deep snow, or dense forest.

- Moving through difficult terrain costs double movement.
    

- Example: 10 ft of difficult terrain uses 20 ft of movement.
    

- Some abilities or spells allow you to ignore difficult terrain.
    

Note: Difficult terrain does not stack, you either treat a space as difficult or not.

Cover

Cover offers protection from ranged attacks, spells, or other effects that require line of sight. A creature behind cover is harder to hit.

There are three types of cover:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Type of Cover|Bonus to AC and Dexterity Saves|
|Half Cover|+2 to AC and DEX saves|
|Three-Quarters|+5 to AC and DEX saves|
|Total Cover|Cannot be targeted directly|

  

Any level of cover also grants advantage on ranged attack and ranged spell attack rolls for the creature who is in cover.
