Ranged attacks in The World of Eyum have structured distance brackets that determine how difficult they are to make. Each ranged weapon or spell lists a base range, which defines how far it can be used normally. Attacks beyond that range are possible but carry penalties.

There are three range brackets:

Normal Range:

- Any attack made within the weapon’s or spell’s base range is considered to be at normal range.
    
- These attacks are resolved as usual, with no penalties.
    

Long Range:

- Long range is double the weapon’s base range (2×).
    
- Attacks made at long range are made at disadvantage unless the weapon, spell, or class feature negates this.
    
- Some weapons (such as bows and thrown weapons) explicitly list a second range value to mark this upper limit.  
    Example: 30/90 means 30 ft normal, up to 90 ft at disadvantage.
    

Extreme Range (Optional Rule):

- This optional bracket allows characters to shoot up to triple the base range (3×), but attacks are made at double disadvantage (roll 3 dice, take the lowest).
    
- This can only be attempted with weapons that logically support high arc or exceptional distance (e.g., longbows, ballistae).
    
- This rule is not used by default and must be approved by the GM on a case-by-case basis.
    

Other Rules for Ranged Attacks:

- You cannot target creatures beyond your maximum effective range (either long or extreme, depending on what’s allowed).
    
- Line of sight and cover still apply at all ranges.
    
- Some magical spells or features may override these limitations or allow auto-hits, tracking, or guided projectiles.
