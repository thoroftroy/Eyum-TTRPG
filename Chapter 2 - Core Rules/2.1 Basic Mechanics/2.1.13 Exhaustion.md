Exhaustion represents a character's declining condition due to overexertion, starvation, lack of rest, or certain magical effects.

Exhaustion is tracked in levels from 1 to 6, with each level imposing increasingly severe penalties:

| Exhaustion Level | Effect                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1                | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
| 2                | Speed halved                                   |
| 3                | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4                | HP and Vitality max reduced by 50%             |
| 5                | Speed reduced to 5ft                           |
| 6                | Death                                          |

Note: These penalties are cumulative. A character with level 3 exhaustion suffers the effects of levels 1, 2, and 3 simultaneously.

Causes of Exhaustion

- Going without food, water, or sleep
    
- Traveling for more than 8 hours without rest
    
- Failing certain saving throws (e.g., extreme environments)
    
- Effects from spells, poisons, or monster abilities
    

Removing Exhaustion

- Short Rest: Does not remove exhaustion.
    
- Long Rest: Removes 1 level of exhaustion with adequate food, water, and sleep.
    
- Magical Means: Some spells can remove exhaustion instantly.
