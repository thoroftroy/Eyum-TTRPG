When your character attempts a specific action that has a chance of failure, like climbing, searching a room, or persuading an NPC, the GM may call for a skill check. This is typically a roll of a d20 plus the relevant attribute modifier and any proficiency bonuses you may have. The GM sets the Difficulty Class (DC), and if your total roll equals or exceeds the DC, you succeed.
###### Requesting a Check
You can always ask to make a different kind of skill check if you feel another skill better fits your approach. For example, if the GM asks for an Investigation check, but you explain why a Wisdom-based Insight check makes more sense, the GM may allow it. Likewise, you can describe your actions and ask if they require a roll, the GM will tell you which skill applies. Remember that the Game Master (GM) always gets the final say, if they don't allow you to choose a different skill, you must abide by their ruling. 
###### Alternative Modifiers
Most skills are tied to a specific attribute, but the GM may allow alternative modifiers in special cases. For instance, Intimidation usually uses Charisma, but if you’re trying to intimidate someone through a display of raw physical power (like lifting a boulder or breaking a weapon), the GM might let you roll Strength instead. These substitutions must be justified by your character’s described actions.
