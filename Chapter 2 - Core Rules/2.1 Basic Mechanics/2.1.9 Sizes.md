###### General Size Rules:
- Reach:  
    Typically, a creatureâ€™s reach is the same as their occupied space unless otherwise noted.
- Movement Through Spaces:  
    You may move through spaces occupied by creatures at least two size categories larger than you without penalty. Smaller size differences require contested checks or special circumstances (GM discretion).
- Grappling & Shoving:  
    You cannot grapple or shove creatures more than one size category larger than yourself without special abilities or magic, however grappling or shoving a creature two or more sizes down grants advantage on the grapple or shove roll (See **Section 2.2.2**).
