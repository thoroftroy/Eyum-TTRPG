**Why this section matters.** Section 2 is the minimum every player is expected to read before play, it’s where the game’s shared language and “how to roll” flow live. Reading 2.1 ([[2.1 Basic Mechanics]]) gives you the core loop of play (roll, add modifiers, compare to a target, interpret results), and it’s fine to reference it in play as needed.

**Note:** Don’t worry about memorizing every rule here. The goal is to understand the basic flow of the game, rolling dice, adding modifiers, and interpreting outcomes. You can always come back and reference this section during play.
