Some effects allow you to reroll dice or add extra dice to a roll. Here’s how these mechanics work:
###### Rerolls (e.g., Advantage, Luck)
When you are allowed to reroll a die (usually from advantage or disadvantage), roll multiple dice and use only the highest single result (for advantage) or the lowest (for disadvantage). advantage and disadvantage only effects d20 rolls, or rolls using 20-Sided Dice. This is for things like skill checks, attack rolls and saving throws. You will never have advantage or disadvantage on damage die or anything else of the sort. You may **not** choose to ignore a reroll once made.

If you have multiple sources of advantage or disadvantage, they interact as follows:
- Each instance of advantage or disadvantage adds one “point” in that direction.
- They cancel each other out one for one.
- You may never have more than Triple advantage/disadvantage (4 dice at once)

Example: If you have 3 sources of advantage and 2 sources of disadvantage, you roll with 1 net advantage.

If your final total is:
- 1+ Advantage: Roll multiple d20s equal to your remaining advantage (up to 3 max), and take the highest.
- 1+ Disadvantage: Roll multiple d20s equal to your remaining disadvantage (up to 3 max), and take the lowest.
- 0 (Neutral): Roll 1d20 as normal.

Note: You can never roll more than 3 dice for a single advantage/disadvantage roll, even if you have more stacked. Any excess is ignored.
