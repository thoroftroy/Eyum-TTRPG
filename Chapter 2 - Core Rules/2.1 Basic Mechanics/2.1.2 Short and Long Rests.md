Short Rest:  
A short rest is a period of downtime lasting at least 30 minutes, where your character can catch their breath, tend to wounds, or prepare potions.

During a short rest, you:

- Regain all your Vitality and 50% of your mana
    
- Refresh certain class features that refresh on a short rest (they will be specified by the skill)
    
- You DO NOT regain any HP during a short rest
    

You do not gain Vitality or mana during a short rest if you have any levels of exhaustion.

Long Rest:  
A long rest takes 8 hours of uninterrupted rest or sleep. During a long rest, you:

- Fully restore HP, Vitality, and Mana
    
- Regain expended abilities and spell uses
    
- Clear all levels of exhaustion 
    

Optional Rule: If your Game Master wants to, they may not allow you to take long rests when in a dungeon or exploring a forest because you won’t really be able to get good rest. In this scenario you would only be able to get a long rest when in a house or actual city with a real bed. 

Note: If a long rest is interrupted (e.g., by combat), it must be fully restarted to gain benefits.
