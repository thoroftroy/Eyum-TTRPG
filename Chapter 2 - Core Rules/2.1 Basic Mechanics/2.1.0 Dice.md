The dice system functions similarly to Dungeons & Dragons. Players will need a standard set of polyhedral dice, including a d20 (20-sided die) for most rolls.

- **Difficulty Class (DC)**: The DC is the target number a player must meet or exceed to succeed on a roll. For example, if the DC for climbing a rope is 10, a player who rolls a 10 or higher succeeds. Rolling below the DC results in failure. Rolling significantly higher than the DC (e.g., 15 or higher on a DC 10) can result in a greater success, with the degree of success increasing the more the DC is exceeded (More details are given below).
- **Ability Modifiers**: Players add their relevant ability modifier to their roll. For example, if a player rolls a 10 and has a +2 modifier, their total is 12 (More details are given below).
- **Critical Rolls**: Rolling a natural 20 (nat 20) or a natural 1 (nat 1) triggers a critical outcome. There are two ways to handle criticals:
	1. Guaranteed Success/Failure: A nat 20 results in the best possible outcome, while a nat 1 results in the worst. For example, in the rope-climbing scenario, a nat 20 might allow the player to climb the rope near instantly, while a nat 1 might cause them to fall and take damage.
	2. Critical Roll Bonuses: Instead of an automatic success, a nat 20 allows the player to roll again and add the results together. This system allows for higher DCs (e.g., 30 or more), making challenges more difficult.
- Crits in Combat: When rolling a Crit on an attack roll (the roll that is contested with a creature's armor class (AC)) you will always hit no matter the AC and you will always deal the maximum possible damage for your attack. For example, if your attack would normally deal 1d8 + 4 then on a crit you would deal 12 damage without needing to roll.
#### Difficulty Class
When rolling a d20 for an action check, a character's success or failure is not always a simple pass/fail. Instead, there are multiple degrees of success that determine how well the action was performed:
- Critical Fail (Roll = Natural 1): The action fails in the worst way possible, always with a major negative consequence. 
- Failure (Roll < DC): The action fails, producing no positive effect. If the roll is 5 or more below the DC, the failure is exceptionally bad, meaning the GM may introduce additional consequences.
- Success (Roll ≥ DC): The action is successful, producing the intended effect.
- Great Success (Roll ≥ DC +5): The action is completed exceptionally well, potentially adding extra benefits at the GM's discretion.    
- Critical Success (Roll = Natural 20 or Roll ≥ DC +10): The action is executed flawlessly, often with additional bonuses or a major advantage granted by the GM.

Example Applications
- Jumping a gap (DC 12)
- Roll 9: The character fails and falls.
- Roll 12: The character barely makes it across.
- Roll 17: The character clears the gap with ease.
- Roll 22: The character lands smoothly and could even take an extra step forward.

Persuading a Guard (DC 15)
- Roll 10: The guard does not believe you.
- Roll 15: The guard lets you through reluctantly.
- Roll 20: The guard trusts you and offers information.
- Roll 25: The guard gives you access and suggests a safer route.

#### Modifiers, Proficiency, and Expertise
Modifiers are the bonuses (or penalties) you add to dice rolls based on your character's core attributes. For example, if you have a Strength of 16, you have a +3 Strength modifier, which applies to actions like Athletics or melee attacks that use Strength.

Proficiency means you're trained in a particular skill, weapon, or type of gear. When you're proficient in something, you add your proficiency bonus to your roll. The bonus starts at somewhere around 1-3 (determined by your class) and increases as you level up (usually every few levels based on your class).
- If you're proficient in a skill (like Stealth or Arcana), you add both your attribute modifier and your proficiency bonus to that skill check.
- If you're proficient in a weapon, you can add your Strength or Dexterity modifier (depending on the weapon) to your attack rolls. Without proficiency, you can’t add that modifier and you can't use special effects or magic from the item.
- You never add your proficiency bonus to an attack roll, proficiency with a weapon only allows you to add your Strength or Dexterity modifier when you normally would not. 
- If you're proficient in a type of armor, you gain its full defensive benefits. If you're not proficient, you suffer penalties and may not be allowed to use it.

Expertise means you are exceptionally skilled at something. In Eyum, this grants advantage on related rolls, meaning you roll twice and take the higher result. Expertise typically applies to weapons, tools, or specific skills you've mastered. Some class features or feats allow you to upgrade proficiency into expertise. For example, if you have proficiency with a weapon attack then you would be able to add your Dexterity mod or Strength mod as well as having advantage on the roll.
#### Ties in Rolls
- If a roll exactly meets the DC, it is considered a success.
- In contested rolls, if both sides roll the same total result, the tie is broken by:
- The participant with the higher relevant attribute modifier winning.    
- If still tied, a reroll may take place.
