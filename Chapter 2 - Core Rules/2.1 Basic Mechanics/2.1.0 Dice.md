The dice system functions similarly to Dungeons & Dragons. Players will need a standard set of polyhedral dice, including a d20 (20-sided die) for most rolls.

- Difficulty Class (DC): The DC is the target number a player must meet or exceed to succeed on a roll. For example, if the DC for climbing a rope is 10, a player who rolls a 10 or higher succeeds. Rolling below the DC results in failure. Rolling significantly higher than the DC (e.g., 15 or higher on a DC 10) can result in a greater success, with the degree of success increasing the more the DC is exceeded.
    
- Ability Modifiers: Players add their relevant ability modifier to their roll. For example, if a player rolls a 10 and has a +2 modifier, their total is 12.
    
- Critical Rolls: Rolling a natural 20 (nat 20) or a natural 1 (nat 1) triggers a critical outcome. There are two ways to handle criticals:
    

1. Guaranteed Success/Failure: A nat 20 results in the best possible outcome, while a nat 1 results in the worst. For example, in the rope-climbing scenario, a nat 20 might allow the player to climb the rope near instantly, while a nat 1 might cause them to fall and take damage.
    
2. Critical Roll Bonuses: Instead of an automatic success, a nat 20 allows the player to roll again and add the results together. This system allows for higher DCs (e.g., 30 or more), making challenges more difficult.
    

- Crits in Combat: When rolling a Crit on an attack roll (the roll that is contested with a creature's armor class (AC)) you will always hit no matter the AC and you will always deal the maximum possible damage for your attack. For example, if your attack would normally deal 1d8 + 4 then on a crit you would deal 12 damage without needing to roll.
