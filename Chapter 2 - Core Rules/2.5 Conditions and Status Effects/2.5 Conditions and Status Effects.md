Conditions are status effects that alter a characterâ€™s abilities or impose penalties. Conditions can be removed through specific means, such as spells, potions, or resting. For example, curses require curse-dispelling magic, while poison can be cured with antidotes.

Multiple Status Effects

- If a character is affected by multiple status effects, each effect is resolved independently.
    

If two effects contradict each other (e.g., Hasted and Slowed), the effects cancel each other out.
