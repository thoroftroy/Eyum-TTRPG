#### What conditions are 
**Conditions** are status effects that change what a creature can do or impose penalties. They end through specific meansâ€”spells, potions, a save, or resting (e.g., curses need curse-dispelling magic; poison needs an antidote).
#### Stacking and contradictions
- If a creature has **multiple** status effects at once, resolve **each independently**.
- If two effects **contradict** one another (e.g., **Hasted** and **Slowed**), they **cancel** each other.
