Some abilities or spells allow you to interrupt another creatureâ€™s action (such as counterspells or triggered defenses).

- If two characters try to interrupt each other at the same time, resolve them in initiative order.
    
- Interrupts can override or cancel the triggering action if the ability or spell allows.
