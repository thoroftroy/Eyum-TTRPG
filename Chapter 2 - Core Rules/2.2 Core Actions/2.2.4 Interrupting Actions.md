**What an interrupt is.**  
Some abilities and spells explicitly say they **interrupt another creature’s action**, classic examples are spells like **Counterspell**. When the listed trigger occurs, you may use the specified ability **outside your turn** to interject before the original action completes.

**How it’s paid for.**  
Use the **cost specified** by the effect. If the interrupt is a **reaction** (as it usually is), it consumes **Reaction Points (RP)**; If the interrupt is a **spell**, it also costs its **Mana** as listed in the spell.

**When it happens in time.**  
An eligible interrupt **resolves immediately when its trigger fires**, before the triggering action finishes. If the interrupt **cancels or overrides** the action (as the effect’s text allows), the original action does not complete. Otherwise, the original action proceeds after the interrupt resolves.

**If two (or more) interrupts collide.**  
When two characters try to interrupt **at the same moment**, resolve them **in initiative order** (highest acting first). After resolving the earlier interrupt, re-check whether the later one still applies.
