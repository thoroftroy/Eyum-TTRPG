Combat is turn-based. Creatures act in initiative order, and your effectiveness depends on how you spend your resources each turn. Understanding and managing your Action Points (AP), Bonus Action Points (BAP), Reaction Points (RP), and movement is the core of tactical play in Eyum. 

Why action economy matters. Encounters are often won or lost on how many actions each side can meaningfully take. Eyum explicitly points out that action economy is “the single most important factor” in encounter balance—more actions can overwhelm, and locking down a foe’s actions can trivialize them. Design, expect, and respond to that reality. 

Companions & Summons. Non-player allies take their own turns on your initiative. By default, a tamed companion has 1 AP, 1 BAP, and 0 RP, and you may spend your RP to grant it a reaction once per round. (Summoned creatures act per their spell.) 

Progression of AP/BAP/RP. Your available points can increase with level (e.g., +1 BAp and +1 Rp every 3 class levels; +1 Ap every 4 class levels), as specified in the leveling rules. Check your character’s current totals before planning a turn.
