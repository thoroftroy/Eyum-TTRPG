**What a “Ready Action” is:**  
On your turn, you may choose to **hold** an action (or bonus action) and state a **specific trigger** and the **specific action** you’ll take when that trigger happens **before** your next turn.

**How it resolves:**  
When the trigger occurs, your readied action **goes off outside your turn** (it functions like a reaction), and you carry out the exact action you declared. The readied action **still costs** the appropriate Action Point (AP) or Bonus Action Point (BAP). If the trigger **doesn’t happen** before your next turn, the action is **lost**.
#### Step-by-step
1. **Declare you’re readying.**  
    “I ready an action.” (This happens on **your** turn.)
2. **Specify the trigger and the action.**  
    Give both parts clearly (trigger -> response), e.g., “**If** the ogre opens the door, **I fire** my bow.” You must explicitly name the trigger **and** the action.
3. **Pay the cost.**  
    A readied **action** costs AP; a readied **bonus action** costs BAP. (You are holding one of the standard actions you could normally take.)
4. **Wait for the trigger.**  
    If it happens before your next turn, your readied action resolves **off-turn** like a reaction; otherwise, it expires unused.
#### What can you ready?
You may ready any **specific action or bonus action** you could normally take when it’s your turn (for example, from the “Common actions” list): **Attack**, **Cast a Spell**, **Use Item**, **Dash**, or **Interact with the Environment**, as long as you name exactly which one you’re holding.
#### Examples 
- “I wait until the **goblin enters the room**, then **I fire my crossbow**.” 
- “**If** the **door opens**, **I fire** my bow.” 
- “**If** the sentry steps into the hall, **I Dash** across to the cover.” 
	- This allows you to move when it is not your turn, but you must move to a specific location that you specify on your turn.
	- Moving past an enemy like this will always provoke Opportunity attacks, even if the Disengage Action was taken on your turn. 
- “**If** our ally hauls the lever, **I Use Item** to toss the rope down.” 

> In every case, you’ll resolve the readied option using the **normal rules** for that action (e.g., make an Attack roll when you ready **Attack**). See the common actions list in **2.2.2** for what each action does.
#### Timing & conflicts (what happens “at the same time”?)
If your readied action **interrupts** something at the exact same moment as another interrupt (for example, two characters’ responses would both trigger together), use the Handbook’s **Interrupting Actions** guidance: resolve simultaneous interrupts **in initiative order**. (See **Section 2.2.4 Interrupting Actions**)
#### Quick table template
- **Trigger:** “If/when **[clear event]** …”
- **Action:** “… **I [specific action or bonus action]**.”
- **Cost:** “This uses **AP/BAP**.”
- **Expiry:** “If it doesn’t happen before my next turn, it’s **lost**.”
