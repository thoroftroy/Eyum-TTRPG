You may choose to “hold” an action until a specified condition is met.

- Example: “I wait until the goblin enters the room, then I fire my crossbow.”
    
- Readied actions still consume the relevant AP or BAP.
    
- If the trigger condition doesn’t happen before your next turn, the action is lost.
