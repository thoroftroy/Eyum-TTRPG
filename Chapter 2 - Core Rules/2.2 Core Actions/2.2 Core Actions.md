Core actions are divided into three main categories: skill checks, combat actions, and social interactions.

- Skill Checks: A skill check occurs when a player attempts a specific action, such as climbing a rope. The player rolls a d20 and adds their relevant ability modifier. The GM sets the DC based on the difficulty of the task. If the player meets or exceeds the DC, they succeed.
    
- Combat Actions: Combat is a significant part of the game. On their turn, a player can take the following types of actions:
    

- Action: A primary action that takes about 6 seconds (the length of a turn). Examples include attacking or casting a spell. Although an action normally takes a full turn, as you level up you will gain multiple action points (Ap) which will allow taking multiple actions in one turn. This applies to Bonus Actions (BaP) and Reactions (Rp) as well. 
    
- Bonus Action: A secondary action, such as equipping a weapon or using a minor ability.
    
- Reaction: A response to another entity’s action, such as an opportunity attack or casting a defensive spell. Players can hold an action to trigger a reaction when specific criteria are met.
    
- Free Actions: Minor actions that require no time, such as speaking or dropping an item.
    

- Social Interactions: Outside of combat, players engage in role-playing conversations with NPCs or each other. Players should act based on their character’s knowledge and motivations, avoiding the use of out-of-character information.
