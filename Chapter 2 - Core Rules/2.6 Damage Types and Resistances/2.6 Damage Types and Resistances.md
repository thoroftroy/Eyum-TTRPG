Note: You don’t need to memorize every damage type or resistance. Just skim to get a sense of what's possible. When a damage type or resistance shows up in play, you can reference this list.
#### Physical Damage Types
These are mundane sources of harm, generally from weapons or bodily force.
- Slashing - Caused by blades or claws. 
- Bludgeoning - Caused by crushing force. 
- Piercing - Caused by arrows, spears, stabs.

Each physical damage type has both a magical and non-magical variant. By default, all sources of Slashing, Bludgeoning, or Piercing damage are non-magical. Many creatures have resistance or even immunity to non-magical damage, which means you must deal damage of the magical variant to harm them effectively. Any attack from a spell or magic item that deals physical damage (such as slashing or bludgeoning) automatically counts as magical damage, bypassing resistance or immunity to non-magical damage.
#### Elemental Damage Types
These stem from elemental forces and interact with the environment or conditions.
- Fire (Heat)
- Water 
- Earth
- Air
#### Magical Damage Types
- Radiant - Holy energy. 
- Necrotic - Death and decay.
- Psychic - Mind attacks. Often bypasses physical defenses.
#### Force Damage
- Represents raw arcane power or planar interference.
- Resistance to Force damage is rare.
#### True Damage
- Unblockable. Ignores all resistances and immunity.
- Rarely dealt except by god-tier spells or final forms.
#### Combination Damage Types 
Combination Damage Types are advanced damage categories formed by merging two or more elemental or magical sources into a single hybrid effect. Unlike standard types, combination damage is not merely thematic, it has unique gameplay consequences, such as bypassing specific resistances or applying status effects. **A creature must resist all components to reduce combination damage.** Because of their complexity and layered effects, combination types are often unpredictable and highly situational, rewarding players who prepare for synergy and exploit weaknesses.The effects dealt by special types will apply even while dealing damage to vitality.

#### Resistances, Vulnerabilities, and Immunities
- Resistance = Half damage
- Vulnerability = Double damage
- Immunity = No damage

Some combination types (e.g., Infernal) bypass resistances unless the creature has a specific resistance of vulnerability to that hybrid type, otherwise having resistances or immunities to all components of a damage type will functionally grant resistance or immunity to that damage type.
