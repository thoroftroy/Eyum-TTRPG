Critical Hit / Fumble:

- Critical Hit: An exceptionally successful attack (often triggered by a natural 20) that deals extra damage or has additional effects.

Saving Throw

A roll made to resist or avoid a harmful effect, such as a spell, poison, or trap. It uses a specific ability modifier (e.g., Constitution, Wisdom) and may include a proficiency bonus if the character is proficient in that saving throw. If the result meets or exceeds the DC (Difficulty Class), the effect is resisted.

Skill Check

A roll made when attempting to perform an action that involves a specific skill (e.g., Stealth, Survival). It is resolved by rolling a d20, adding the relevant ability modifier, and any proficiency or bonuses the character has in that skill. The result is compared to a DC set by the GM.

Ability Check

Any roll that tests a character's raw ability in one of the six core attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma). Most skill checks are also ability checks, but not all ability checks involve a listed skill (e.g., pushing a boulder may be a pure Strength check).

Modifier

The numerical bonus or penalty derived from a character’s ability score. Calculated as:

(Ability Score − 10) ÷ 2, rounded down

Example: Strength 15 gives a +2 modifier.

Attack Roll

A d20 roll made when trying to hit a target with a weapon, spell, or ability. It uses the relevant modifier (Strength, Dexterity, or Spellcasting Modifier) and may include a proficiency bonus if the character is proficient with the attack type. Success occurs when the result meets or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC).

Hit Roll

Another term for Attack Roll. Both refer to the roll made to determine whether an attack successfully hits the target.

Concentration Save (Concentration Check)

A saving throw made to maintain the effect of a spell or ability that requires concentration. If the caster takes damage, they must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 or half the damage taken (whichever is higher). Failure ends the effect.

Legendary Actions

Special actions that powerful monsters or bosses may use outside of their normal turn. They can take a limited number of legendary actions at the end of another creature’s turn. These are unique to specific monsters and are detailed in their stat block.

Initiative

The order in which characters act in combat. At the start of combat, each participant rolls a d20 and adds their Dexterity modifier. Higher results act first. Some feats or class features may modify this.
