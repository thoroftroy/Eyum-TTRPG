This guide is general information and advice that all Players should know and understand. 
#### How to Build a Thematic Character
A good character is more than just a collection of stats and combat abilities. In The World of Eyum, creating a compelling and memorable character means building someone whose story, mechanics, and personality are woven together from the very beginning. This doesn’t just improve roleplay, it strengthens the entire campaign, gives your GM more to work with, and helps you stay invested in your journey.

Start with your character’s past. Who were they before the game began? What mattered to them? Were they a tradesperson, a soldier, a runaway, or something stranger? What did they lose, or leave behind, to end up where they are now? You don’t need a five-page essay, but you do need a clear emotional foundation. This is what makes the character real. Think about one or two defining memories: a betrayal, a discovery, a promise, or a tragedy. These moments can shape everything from class selection to how the character reacts to danger or trust.

From there, think about their goals. What do they want now? Why do they adventure? It might be survival, redemption, knowledge, power, or vengeance. Whatever it is, it should be something that motivates them across sessions. Characters who have no desire or drive tend to feel disconnected from the world. Give your character something personal to pursue, even if it's just the hope of finding a place to belong.

When choosing your race, don’t just look at the mechanical bonuses. Each race in Eyum comes with its own history, worldview, and cultural texture. A Ferramite isn’t just tough, they were shaped by hardship and labor. A Lumari isn’t just mystical, they’re tied to illusion, secrecy, and ancient bloodlines. Choosing a race should mean choosing a lens through which your character sees the world. If you want to play against type, that’s fine, but acknowledge it in your backstory. A kind-hearted pacifist Gorul makes for a great twist, but it should be intentional, not accidental.

Once your background is clear, tie it into your class and subclass. Why did your character become what they are? Did a Sorcerer’s magic awaken violently during a crisis? Did a Bard begin playing to escape their past or win over a hostile court? Did your Fighter learn to fight in the arena, or while defending their home from raiders? Class choice should emerge naturally from your character’s life, not just be a mechanical decision. Subclass choice, too, should reflect something about who they are becoming, what they’ve committed to, what they’ve accepted, or what they’ve learned.

Add detail by defining a few clear personality traits, flaws, and habits. Are they reckless? Overconfident? Compassionate but naive? Do they struggle with trust, anger, or guilt? Pick flaws that matter, ones that could affect group decisions or complicate their goals. Eyum is a world where emotional weight carries forward, and your character should be someone who grows, not just someone who levels up. You don’t need to write these all down, but you as the player do need to know them.

You should also name a few people in your character’s life, friends, family, mentors, rivals, or even enemies. These associates don’t have to be central to the plot, but they make the world feel lived in. Give your GM some names and connections they can bring into the story. It adds weight to your character’s choices when they’re not fighting for “the world,” but for someone specific.

Finally, don’t forget that your character exists in a world with factions, cultures, and history. Where are they from? What region shaped them? Do they belong to any group, cause, or belief system? Did they break from tradition, or are they carrying on a legacy? Use your backstory to define your relationship to the world, and to give your GM tools to make your character feel like a natural part of it.

A thematic character is one whose class, race, background, and personality are all pulling in the same direction. They don’t have to be optimized, they have to make sense. And when they do, you’ll find that your choices in combat, exploration, and story moments feel more natural, more rewarding, and more personal. That’s the kind of character people remember. That’s the kind of character who belongs in Eyum.
#### How to Contribute in Combat (Even If You're Not the Strongest)
Combat in The World of Eyum is dangerous, tactical, and often unforgiving. Some characters will deal massive damage, soak up hits, or dominate the battlefield from the start. But raw damage is not the only way to be valuable in combat. No matter your class or build, you have tools to shift the tide of a fight, if you understand your role, play to your strengths, and act with purpose.

The first thing to understand is that combat isn’t just about numbers. It’s about momentum and control. You can influence a battle by protecting your allies, disrupting the enemy’s plans, managing space, or forcing difficult choices. You don’t need to be the one dealing the final blow, you need to be the one making that blow possible.

Every character has a role in combat, whether they’re built for it or not. Traditional roles include:
- Tank - Draws aggro, soaks damage, and holds choke points. Often the frontline.
- DPS - Focuses on raw damage, ideally eliminating high-priority threats quickly.
- Support - Buffs allies, heals wounds, and keeps the team in fighting condition.
- Controller - Uses spells or positioning to limit enemy movement or abilities.
- Tactician - Makes smart use of items, positioning, terrain, and mechanics to create opportunities for others.

You don’t need to fit cleanly into one of these roles, but you should know where your strengths lie. A Rogue who can’t frontline still contributes massively by eliminating weak targets. A Bard may never kill an enemy, but a well-placed debuff or Bardic Inspiration can turn a guaranteed loss into a win.

Positioning is one of the most underrated ways to contribute. Block a hallway to prevent reinforcements. Flank an enemy to give allies better hit chances. Move to protect a squishier caster from getting jumped. These decisions matter far more than one extra point of damage.

Items are another major factor. Eyum’s combat system rewards creative item use, bombs, potions, improvised gear, and environmental tools can shift the balance of a fight. If you’re not hitting hard, make yourself useful by pulling out a smoke bomb, disarming a trap mid-combat, or tossing a healing potion to an ally. Never be afraid to use your gear, it’s there for a reason.

Communication also sets good players apart. Ask your teammates what they need. Declare your intent clearly. If you’re planning to shove an enemy into a trap or delay an attack to let the Cleric heal, let the others know. Eyum isn’t just about mechanics, it’s about teamwork. Coordinated parties win. Disconnected ones fall apart.

Remember that survivability is its own contribution. Going down early in the fight because you tried to “prove” your damage isn’t helping anyone. Sometimes, the smartest move is to guard a healer, retreat from danger, or spend a turn regrouping. Staying on your feet means more turns to help your team.

If you’re feeling underpowered, don’t disengage, adapt. Talk to your GM between sessions about what your character is good at and where they want to grow. Sometimes the best thing you can do is double down on a unique strength. You don’t have to be the best at everything. You just have to matter.

In Eyum, survival is a group effort. If you can create space, protect your allies, outthink the enemy, or change the battlefield, even without big damage, you’re doing your job. Your role is never irrelevant. Lean into it.
#### Making Smart Choices at Low Levels
Low-level play in The World of Eyum is not a tutorial. It is dangerous, dynamic, and often lethal. You are not a hero yet, you are a survivor, a student, or a soldier at the start of a long and brutal path. While higher levels unlock flashy spells and powerful subclass features, levels 1 through 3 are about learning how to survive with limited resources, making deliberate decisions, and setting the tone for your character’s future. If you treat low-level play like filler, you’re going to get someone killed, maybe yourself.

The first rule of low-level survival is simple: don't overextend. Your health is low, your mana is limited, and your gear is likely weak or improvised. This is not the time to charge into five enemies alone or burn your last mana points on a minor spell. Pace yourself. Hold something in reserve. Know when to push and when to retreat. Combat in Eyum doesn’t scale for fairness, it scales based on logic. If you walk into a den of bandits thinking the GM will “go easy because you’re level 1,” you’ll be a corpse before round three.

Know what your character is good at, and what they’re not. If you're a fragile caster, stay back and play smart. If you're a martial character, don’t just swing, control space, body block, and protect your allies. Smart players at low levels play together, not as individuals. Always be aware of positioning, enemy numbers, and escape routes. Even just moving to cover or holding an action can make a massive difference. You don't need to win every fight, you just need to live through it.

Invest in useful gear early. Healing items, basic bombs, traps, or defensive tools can be more valuable than a stat bonus. Don't hoard your items, they’re meant to be used. If you're not sure what to buy or scavenge, ask your GM or look for ways your background could justify starting equipment. Crafting systems and tools become more relevant as you level, but at low levels, smart item usage can be a lifesaver.

Pay attention to your party's composition and synergy. If no one can heal, don’t just hope you’ll be fine. If everyone picked glass cannon builds, someone needs to take on a tanking or utility role, even temporarily. Party balance matters most when resources are scarce and combat is fast. You’re not just playing your sheet, you’re playing your team.

Also, look for opportunities to earn small advantages outside of combat. Ask questions, use your background skills, explore carefully, and try to gather information before committing to a fight. Low-level groups that scout, plan, and avoid bad terrain win more encounters than ones that blindly engage. Creative solutions are rewarded in Eyum. Don’t be afraid to play dirty, bargain with enemies, or exploit the environment. Low-level success often comes from outsmarting, not overpowering.

Finally, take the time to define your character’s path. What do they want to become? What subclass or power goal are they working toward? What weaknesses are they trying to overcome? Even if you don’t have the resources to specialize yet, you should be planting the seeds now. A character who wants to be a holy warrior may start by protecting others and learning to endure. A future necromancer might begin collecting bones or researching obscure rituals. Eyum rewards commitment to identity, even before your stats catch up.

Low-level play in Eyum is not about surviving until the “real game” begins. It is the real game. It teaches you how to think, how to act under pressure, and how to grow. If you treat it with respect, your character will not only survive, it will feel earned.
#### How to Roleplay Without Slowing the Game
Roleplaying is one of the most rewarding parts of The World of Eyum, but it’s also one of the easiest places for the game’s pace to break down. When done well, roleplay deepens immersion, strengthens character bonds, and brings the world to life. When done poorly, it can grind a session to a halt, alienate other players, or cause confusion. The goal is not to act perfectly or give dramatic speeches, it’s to play a believable character in a way that keeps the game moving forward.

Start by understanding your role in the party’s story. You don’t need to be a spotlight-stealing performer. In fact, Eyum tends to reward collaborative, grounded roleplay more than theatrical monologues. Know who your character is, how they speak, and what they care about, and then show that through action and choice. You can roleplay with a sentence, a gesture, or even a silence. Not every moment needs to be a scene.

The most important principle is timing. Don’t interrupt fast-paced scenes (like combat or urgent decision points) with long backstory reveals or personal drama. Save deeper conversations for downtime, travel, or quiet moments. If you're not sure whether it's the right time to speak up, ask the group or GM out of character. A simple “Can we do a quick roleplay scene?” goes a long way toward keeping the flow respectful.

Try to share the spotlight. If you’ve had a long character moment, step back and invite others into the scene. If another player’s arc is front and center, support them rather than redirecting the focus. Good roleplayers don’t just act, they listen, respond, and elevate others. Some of the best scenes come not from planned speeches, but from genuine character-to-character dialogue where everyone gets to contribute.

Use roleplay to reinforce, not replace, your mechanics. If you’re intimidating an enemy, roll for it. If you're making a clever argument, back it up with your Charisma. Don’t use acting as a way to bypass the system, Eyum is designed for mechanics and narrative to support each other. Let your stats inform how you roleplay success or failure. A low-Charisma character might ramble awkwardly even if the player is articulate. A high-Wisdom character might see through deception without needing to say a word.

Keep your character consistent but flexible. You should know how they react to pressure, to authority, to temptation, but leave room for growth. Eyum’s story will challenge your character’s values. Let them change over time. A stubborn mercenary might learn to care. A zealot might start to doubt. You don’t need to plan your arc, but you should be open to it evolving. That’s where the best roleplay lives, not in perfection, but in adaptation.

Lastly, remember that roleplaying is a group activity. You’re not here to perform at the table, you’re here to build something with the table. Check in with other players if you're unsure whether your character's behavior is disruptive or entertaining. Some tables love conflict between characters; others find it draining. Respect those boundaries. The best roleplay happens when everyone feels safe, heard, and engaged.

In Eyum, roleplay isn’t a separate mode, it’s woven into the system. Use it to shape your choices, strengthen your identity, and explore your flaws. Just keep one eye on the story and the other on your party. If you do that, your character will come to life, and the game will keep moving.
#### What to Do On (and Off) Your Turn
In The World of Eyum, the game doesn’t stop when it’s not your turn. Whether you're in combat, exploration, or a roleplay scene, every player shares responsibility for keeping the session focused, moving, and meaningful. While the rules give each player a turn in initiative or dialogue, the game world is constantly shifting, and the way you engage between turns can have as much impact as what you do during them.

On your turn, your job is to act clearly, decisively, and with intent. This doesn’t mean rushing, but it does mean being ready. Know your abilities, keep track of your health and resources, and think ahead while others are going. When your name is called, take the spotlight seriously. Ask yourself: What does my character want to do right now? How can I support the party? Is this the right time to push, reposition, defend, or improvise?

But just as importantly, off your turn, your job is to stay present. That means putting your phone away, keeping one ear on the action, and being ready to respond. Too often, players mentally check out when it’s not “their turn,” but Eyum is a game of constant motion. You might be called on for a reaction, a saving throw, or a tactical choice in the middle of someone else’s move. If you’re distracted, the moment passes, and the party suffers.

During roleplay scenes, pay attention even if you’re not speaking. Watch how other characters act. Take notes on what NPCs say. Ask yourself: How would my character feel about this? Would they approve, intervene, or stay silent? Even if you’re quiet, you’re still playing. And when you do speak, respect pacing, don’t interrupt or derail scenes just to insert yourself. Wait for a natural opening, or ask the GM to cut to you when the timing fits.

The spotlight should shift throughout the session. If it’s been on you for a while, during a duel, a social confrontation, or a long backstory reveal, be conscious of it. Finish your moment, then pass it on. Let someone else shine. Similarly, if another player is having a key moment, support it. Stay in character, react visibly, and offer short, meaningful contributions that enhance the scene instead of dragging it sideways.

In combat, you can stay engaged by tracking initiative order, planning your next move, watching for combo setups, or preparing a reaction. Know what your character can do even when it's not their turn. Can you intercept an enemy? Shield an ally? Shout a warning? If you don’t know, ask. Eyum rewards coordination, and the best players know how to act with the group, not just beside them.

Avoid passive disengagement. Don’t use “it’s not my turn” as a reason to zone out. Don’t wait to be told what’s happening. Be part of the scene, whether it's combat, dialogue, or downtime. Help manage initiative, call out rules when needed, or keep track of party resources. The more engaged you are between turns, the smoother and more enjoyable the game becomes, for everyone.

Being a good player isn’t just about what you do on your turn. It’s about how you play the whole session. Stay sharp. Pay attention. Respect the spotlight. And always look for ways to lift the scene, whether it’s yours or not.
#### Using Items, Gear, and Crafting

In The World of Eyum, items and gear aren’t just stat bonuses, they’re survival tools, power enhancers, and storytelling devices. Whether it’s a hand-welded axe, a salvaged potion, or a rare alchemical component, what you carry shapes how you play. Players who pay attention to their gear are often the ones who survive longer, hit harder, and solve problems the others don’t even see.

First, understand that items are not decorations. They are often your most flexible and reliable resource. Weapons define your range, damage type, and style. Armor can be the difference between surviving an ambush and bleeding out on the floor. Tools let you bypass obstacles, disable traps, or create improvised solutions. Even mundane items, rope, oil, a mirror, chalk, can solve critical problems with a little creativity.

Don’t wait for the perfect moment to use your gear. Use it now. If you’re holding onto a bomb, throw it. If you’ve got a potion, drink it. Eyum is not a game that rewards hoarding (generally), it rewards smart, tactical use of your inventory. If you never use your tools because you're “saving them for later,” chances are good you'll never use them at all.

Pay close attention to item properties. Some weapons are heavier but ignore some armor. Some are faster, easier to hide, or deal specific damage types. You might want to carry a backup weapon for different enemy types. Likewise, bombs, poisons, and special ammunition can dramatically change your effectiveness in the right fight. If you’re not sure what an item does, ask the GM or experiment. Most items aren’t limited by class, anyone can carry and use a tool if they understand it.

When it comes to crafting, Eyum opens even more possibilities. Characters can collect materials from dungeons, monsters, or the environment and use them to forge weapons, mix potions, create bombs, or upgrade existing gear. This system encourages exploration, rare items aren’t bought, they’re found. If you want to be powerful, don’t just look for gold, look for components. Ask yourself: What can I build that no one else has? What unique item could define my character?

If you're playing a class that interacts directly with crafting, like an Alchemist or a Runemaster, you should be tracking your materials constantly. Plan recipes, keep your pack organized, and think about what kind of gear you want to make next. If you're not a crafting-heavy class, you should still engage with the system. Even a single well-timed crafted item can swing a fight, or save your life.

You can also personalize your gear. Describe it, name it, connect it to your character’s story. Did you make that sword yourself? Is that talisman a gift from a mentor? Did you scavenge that armor from a ruined temple? Eyum thrives on immersion, and when your equipment is part of your narrative identity, not just a stat block, it becomes something you care about.

Finally, talk to your GM about opportunities to trade, steal, barter, or earn items through the world. Markets, faction vendors, or secret caches can give you access to gear no one else has. Look beyond the character sheet and into the world around you. If you want something, go after it.

In Eyum, items are not just a side system, they are a core part of your power and your playstyle. Keep your inventory active. Use what you carry. Build what you need. And make sure that every item you bring feels like it belongs to you.
#### Surviving Dangerous Encounters

Combat in The World of Eyum is not designed to be fair. It's designed to be deadly, reactive, and meaningful. Many enemies can kill a careless player in a single round. Some fights can’t be won through brute force. The difference between survival and a quick death often comes down to what you do before the first blow is struck, and how well you adapt once the fight begins.

The first step to survival is understanding the risk. If you’re walking into a crypt crawling with necrotic energy or dealing with a beast that locals whisper about, assume it’s dangerous. Don’t charge blindly. Ask questions. Scout. Plan. Use your background or known associates to gather intel. Just because the GM has placed a fight in front of you doesn’t mean you’re expected to win it right now. You can retreat. You can return later. Survival is a choice.

When combat does start, positioning is everything. Stay close to allies who can support you, avoid exposing your back or sides to multiple enemies, and don’t isolate yourself unless you’re built to tank. If you're ranged, keep to cover and avoid tight spaces. If you're melee, control chokepoints and protect weaker allies. Use the environment, tables, doorways, ledges, furniture. Treat every battlefield like a puzzle, not a flat map.

Focus fire matters. A party that splits its attacks across too many enemies will get overwhelmed. Identify key threats, casters, leaders, glass-cannon monsters, and take them down first. Talk to your party. Coordinate. If you don't work together, you will die separately.

Don’t save everything for later. Use your bombs, your potions, your traps, and your biggest spells when the situation calls for it. This system doesn't reward hoarding, it rewards timely use. It’s better to end the fight fast than to stretch it out hoping to conserve resources while your health slips away.

Pay attention to the momentum of the fight. Who has control? If the enemies are forcing you to move, draining your mana, or boxing you in, you’re losing. Look for ways to shift momentum: disrupt their formation, change the terrain, or hit their support units. Survival isn’t always about out-damaging, it’s about destabilizing the enemy.

Know when to retreat. This is not a game where every encounter is scaled to your power level. If the fight is going badly, someone is down, you’re boxed in, the enemy hasn’t even used its major abilities yet, call a retreat. Throw smoke, use a distraction, or disengage. Smart escapes are part of what makes Eyum feel real. Live to fight again.

Play to your strengths. If you're a healer, keep people up, not just at 1 HP, but stable and able to act. If you're a controller, block movement, slow reinforcements, or deny key areas. If you're a tank, don’t chase stragglers, hold the line. Know your role and lean into it.

Finally, don’t panic when things go wrong. They will. People will fall. Surprises will happen. That’s Eyum. Think clearly. Look for creative options. Could you throw an enemy off a ledge? Pull a lever? Talk your way out mid-combat? Can you delay just long enough for reinforcements? Panic kills more characters than enemies ever will.

Survival in Eyum is not about having the best stats. It’s about staying alert, acting with intention, and knowing your limits. Play smart. Fight together. And if things go sideways, remember: the world doesn’t care that you’re the main character, only whether you make it out alive.
#### Multiclassing Without Ruining Your Build

The World of Eyum is designed with multiclassing in mind. It’s not just allowed, it’s encouraged. Unlike some systems where multiclassing can easily break your character or leave you behind, Eyum treats class levels as modular tools. Each class gives you something unique at level 1, and many continue to offer strong, specialized features as you progress. Smart multiclassing lets you shape your character’s growth, adapt to new challenges, and carve out a playstyle that’s entirely your own.

That said, multiclassing isn’t just about grabbing flavor, it’s about making meaningful choices. You should only multiclass into a class if you actually plan to use what it gives you. If you don’t want to cast spells, don’t take levels in Wizard. If you’re never going to brew or throw bombs, don’t take Alchemist. Picking up a class just because it “sounds cool” or offers a minor passive bonus will almost always lead to dead weight on your sheet.

Think about what a new class actually adds to your gameplay. Will you gain access to a damage type or ability you didn’t have before? Does it fill a gap, like healing, mobility, or defense? Does it match your character’s story arc or tactical needs? If the answer is yes, it’s probably a great pick. But if you’re only grabbing it for a single mechanic you might never use, you’re probably better off investing deeper in what you already do well.

Multiclassing works best when you commit to using the features you gain. If you take a level in Cleric, you should be healing or supporting . If you dip into Rogue, you should be using positioning, sneak attacks, or mobility to change how you fight. The more you integrate those new tools into your actual combat behavior and character identity, the more powerful and cohesive your build becomes.

You don’t have to fully “finish” a class before branching out. Many classes in Eyum front-load powerful abilities at level 1 or 2, making them attractive for tactical multiclassing. But always look ahead. Ask yourself: If I take this level now, what am I giving up later? Could I delay a powerful subclass feature or upgrade? Some classes unlock key features at level 3 or 5. Be aware of your timing.

Also, remember that subclass identity matters. If you multiclass into a new class, you’re also committing to a second subclass. Don’t treat it like a throwaway, subclasses often define the role and tone of your character. They’re not just mechanical, they’re narrative. Picking a subclass just to farm one passive bonus usually results in a character with unclear focus or overlapping features that don’t sync.

Finally, multiclassing is a chance to reflect your character’s evolution. Did they undergo a major trauma, and now they’re developing magical potential? Did they leave behind their temple and become a blade for hire? Use multiclassing to show that growth. Your character’s story and mechanics should evolve together, not in conflict.

Multiclassing in Eyum is generally a good choice. It lets you round out your weaknesses, specialize into hybrid roles, and access combinations no single class can offer. Just remember: don’t take what you won’t use. Multiclassing should expand your gameplay, not clutter your character sheet. Be deliberate. Be committed. And build something worth playing.
#### Respecting the Table

No matter how compelling your character is, how clever your tactics are, or how deep your backstory runs, none of it matters if you’re a bad tablemate. The World of Eyum is a game about survival, collaboration, and storytelling. That means every player at the table matters just as much as you do. Respecting the game means respecting the people playing it with you.

The first and most important rule: this is a group story, not a solo campaign. That means everyone deserves time to shine, to speak, and to shape the story. If you’re dominating every conversation, interrupting scenes, or hijacking every combat plan, you’re not playing a better character, you’re just playing alone in a shared space. Step back when the spotlight isn’t yours. Let other players have their moments. Support their decisions, even if they’re not the ones you’d make.

During roleplay, listen as much as you speak. Don’t jump in every time an NPC finishes a sentence. Let quieter players contribute. Some of the best roleplay scenes aren’t about fast-talking or dramatic monologues, they’re about authentic character interaction. If another character is going through something big, don’t undercut it with a joke or tangent. Be present. Be generous.

In combat, communicate clearly and don’t delay your turn. Stay engaged even when it’s not your moment to act. Don’t check out or start side conversations while others are playing. The faster and more focused everyone is, the more time you all get to spend immersed in the world, not waiting for someone to notice it’s their turn in initiative.

If a disagreement comes up, about rules, outcomes, or decisions, handle it maturely. You can question a ruling, but do it respectfully. Don’t argue for five minutes about one ability. Trust that your GM is trying to be fair, and if something truly feels wrong, bring it up after the session. In-game disputes should be settled in character. Out-of-game friction should be handled calmly, with clarity and compassion.

Don’t metagame. Your character doesn’t know enemy stats, plot twists, or what the GM is foreshadowing. Don’t use player knowledge to manipulate outcomes or steal agency. Let your character make mistakes. Let the world surprise you.

Also: be mindful of tone. Eyum supports dark, heavy themes, but your table might not. If you want to play a violent or morally complex character, check with your group. If you enjoy character conflict, make sure everyone’s on board. Consent and trust are non-negotiable. Everyone should feel safe and respected, even when characters argue or struggle.

Lastly, come prepared. Know your abilities, bring your materials, and take notes when needed. Show up on time. Be present. The more seriously you treat the game, the more seriously everyone else will too.

Respecting the table isn’t about rules, it’s about responsibility. You are one piece of a shared world, and the better you play with others, the better everyone’s story becomes.
