Each class in The World of Eyum has three types of dice that determine your durability and magical stamina:

- Vitality Dice - Used to calculate your Vitality (the buffer that protects your true health)
    
- Hit Dice - Used to calculate your Hit Points (HP) (your actual health, if it hits 0, you die)
    
- Mana Dice - Used to calculate your Mana (your magical energy used to cast spells or abilities)
    

When your class lists something like Vitality Dice: 2d10+1d12, it means that each time you gain a level in that class, you roll all those dice to determine how much your Vitality increases. You never just roll one of the dice, you always roll the full set listed.

Example:

If youâ€™re a Fighter, your vitality dice are 2d12. That means every time you gain a level in Fighter, you roll two 12-sided dice to see how much your Vitality increases.

If your class has Mana Dice: 1d4, then every time you level up in that class, you roll one 4-sided die to see how much Mana you gain. You will also add a modifier to this number each level, that being the modifier of the stat which is your spell casting modifier. For example, a warlock uses their charisma modifier as their spell casting modifier so if you have a +2 in charisma when you roll your mana dice you would add 2

Important: These dice are rolled once per level when increasing your max stats.
