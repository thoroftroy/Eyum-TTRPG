Appearance: A centipede-wyrm plated in pearly ice-blue armor that glows from within like banked coals. Heat ripples off its back in mirage waves, leaving snow slumped into glassy bowls where it waits.  
Disposition: Glacier trapper. It lurks beneath drifted ice, senses footfalls, and erupts to bite and pin a single target while its furnace-back scorches anyone brave enough to help. It tunnels to slough heat into new vents, forcing the party to chase through steam and collapsing snow bridges.

Thermal Tunnel: As a bonus action after burrowing, the remorhaz creates a 10-ft-radius lightly obscuring steam cloud in the space it vacated.
