If one side successfully ambushes the other, the ambushing party always goes first, regardless of initiative rolls.

- Surprise rounds are resolved before regular initiative begins.
    

- In this surprise round all members of the ambushing party get to take their turns before the actual initiative of the fight. This means that if the players go first in initiative and have a surprise round then they will get two turns before the opposing side.Â 
    

- Only creatures unaware of the ambush are affected (If a creature is immune to surprise or is aware of the ambush they go during the surprise round like normal).
