When a character or NPC reaches 0 HP, they die instantly. Some spells or abilities may specify a revival window (e.g., “revivable within 10 minutes”). If used in time, the creature can still be brought back.

However, once a character has been dead for more than 48 hours, their soul becomes unreachable. No magic, ritual, or divine act, regardless of power, can return them. At that point, death is final.

This makes healers, especially those with resurrection magic, critically important to any adventuring party. If your character dies and no one has the means to bring them back in time, you’ll likely need to begin creating a new character.
