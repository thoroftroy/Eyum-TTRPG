There is cannon Lore in The World of Eyum, you are welcome to use this world or not, it doesn't matter. Largely this exists as an easy way for me to run through fights and making characters and things on my own. 


[[Lucian]] — who he is  
Lucian is a boy raised in warmth who never grew out of believing that kindness works. He’s not innocent because he doesn’t know better; he’s innocent because he keeps choosing to be. To strangers he looks almost simple—earnest, literal, unguarded—but people who spend time with him see the will behind it. He wants a world where the default is to help, so he goes first. That’s the core you write from in every scene: he is childishly naïve in presentation—blurting the generous interpretation, assuming the best—yet stubbornly principled underneath. He says yes to errands that slow him down. He gives away rations. He refuses to call someone “enemy” until they force the term to fit. Those instincts aren’t window dressing; they’re the choices that make the later fall hurt and the final acceptance land.

Backstory (anchoring beliefs)  
Lucian grows up under Ezra’s care with Illana at his side. Ezra teaches discipline in power and tenderness in motive: light isn’t a weapon first, it’s a way to see. That pairing is why Lucian believes two things at once: that people can be saved, and that it’s his responsibility to try. He holds onto those beliefs hard because they gave structure to his childhood—food, safety, stories, the steady cadence of “do the next kind thing.” When Ezra disappears, what goes missing isn’t just a mentor; it’s the ritual that made meaning out of days. His search for her is a quest for a person and a fight to keep the story of the world he was taught from collapsing. That’s why he will keep stopping to help on the road even when it “slows the plot”—because helping is his plot.

What he does in this book (the new throughline)  
Book One is “Lucian’s Grief,” not as a slow dissolve into rage but as a structured passage he survives. He pursues leads on Ezra while compulsively helping the people those leads harm or ignore: he mends a village’s well instead of demanding payment for information; he escorts a wounded courier who has the next clue but can’t travel alone; he insists on returning a stolen charm to a child even when an informant is waiting. These detours are no longer filler—they are the way he proves to himself that he hasn’t abandoned Ezra’s way while he searches for her. The cost is real: lost hours, missed chances, second-best intel. That tension carries him scene to scene.

Why he does it (motive under pressure)  
Lucian helps because not helping feels like betraying Ezra and betraying himself. He’s terrified that if he starts cutting corners with strangers, he’ll eventually cut a hole through Illana, through Ezra, through the boy Ezra raised. He rationalizes detours with “we have time” even when he knows they don’t. When that scaffolding cracks (a lead goes cold, a survivor dies he might have saved, Illana is hurt or lost), he doesn’t flip to cruelty. He flails. He over-promises. He tries to out-work the grief. Only when he runs out of ways to make it hurt less does he look at Mr. P’s offer with anything but disgust.

Abilities (and how to stage them now)  
Lucian channels solar fire: controlled heat for craft and care; blazing radiance for defense; catastrophic pillars when he loses hold. Reframe his combat language as “non-lethal first, lethal only when cornered.” Early/mid book, he defaults to soft and containing tools—blinding flares, heat-melds that weld doors shut, radiant wards that push foes back, searing trip-lines across floors. When he’s overwhelmed, he spikes into frightening output but still tries to aim it between bodies, not through them. Only in the late second half—when bargaining fails and depression sets in—do we let the wild pillar appear, and even then give him immediate remorse and restraint. Mechanically this gives you a clean ladder: Disarm → Deter → Disable → Destroy. You can escalate tension without betraying the new “no sudden murder spree” rule.

Loyalties and bonds  
Ezra is the axis; everything he thinks about duty spins around her absence. Illana is the person who translates his ideals into travel plans and keeps him from giving away the whole journey to every stranger’s emergency. Their bond is not romantic performance; it’s the shorthand of two people who learned to be brave in the same house. Ge-orge (or George, depending on your final spelling choice) begins as a stress test for Lucian’s hope—abrasive, compromised, too practiced at using people. Lucian’s insistence that anyone can be saved lands hardest on him; their friction is narrative fuel. Mr. P is the dark mirror that temporarily becomes a mentor-of-convenience: a patient voice promising the one outcome Lucian can’t stop fantasizing about—undoing death.

Role in the story (function and theme)  
Lucian is the test case for whether compassion can survive consequence. The book answers “yes,” but only after he learns that compassion without boundaries becomes cruelty by another name. He does not end the story the same boy; he ends as someone who can say “no” to a plea because saying “yes” would break three other people. Acceptance for him is not peace; it’s clarity.

Five-stages grief arc (integrated into one book)

1. Denial — “She’s fine if I move fast enough.”  
    Opening act. He interprets every sign as proof Ezra is alive and within reach. He refuses rest, refuses the idea that his small helps matter less than speed. Scene tools: brisk travel punctuated by helping vignettes; cheerful overconfidence; a first brush with the Iron Path brushed off as noise.
    
2. Anger — “If the world won’t be good, I’ll make it behave.”  
    A lead is lost or a person dies because he chose help over haste. He erupts—but you keep it measured. He raises heat, terrifies a room, scorches walls, not people. He learns that power used like a blunt instrument makes him more like the men he hates. Scene tools: a public outburst he immediately regrets; Illana steps between him and an easy kill; Ge-orge calls him a child and isn’t wrong.
    
3. Bargaining — “There has to be a way to pay the universe back.”  
    He starts making deals—small ones with himself (“I’ll skip the next detour”), then with dubious allies. This is where Mr. P’s emissary or Mr. P himself brushes close: knowledge for compromises that feel procedural, not monstrous. He agrees to work with Mr. P temporarily to “learn how to reverse” what’s already happened, promising himself he won’t cross certain lines. Scene tools: experiments framed as harmless, a warding ritual that needs something living “only briefly,” a ledger of rationalizations Illana reads with growing fear.
    
4. Depression — “Maybe kindness is just another lie.”  
    The cost ledger won’t balance. Something he tried to save breaks anyway. He goes quiet. Fewer detours. He does tasks mechanically, obeys Mr. P’s instructions like a sleepwalker, and his magic becomes coldly efficient—still non-lethal where possible, but drained of warmth. This is the moral nadir, not a murder spree. Scene tools: a near-fatal miscalculation; a small mercy from a stranger that pierces the fog; a simple funeral he finally lets himself attend.
    
5. Acceptance — “I cannot fix death, but I can refuse to spread it.”  
    Climax. Lucian confronts the full shape of Mr. P’s program and understands that the method is the message: you cannot resurrect love by killing what makes you lovable. He severs the alliance, refuses the final price, and reclaims agency. In the final confrontation, he uses the pillar on empty sky or stone to end the fight without ending a life, or he channels it into a barrier that saves others at cost to himself. He does not get Ezra “back” the way he wanted; he gets to keep who he is.
    

Practical guardrails for writing him scene-to-scene

- Default to help. Every time you’re unsure what he does, ask: “What’s the smallest useful kindness he can do right now?” Let that choice create the next problem.
    
- Keep the harm ladder visible (Disarm → Deter → Disable → Destroy). Only climb when a specific beat justifies it, and step back down as soon as he recognizes the cost.
    
- Let him be funny by accident (earnest literalness) and inspiring on purpose (chooses the hard right).
    
- Regression is okay. Grief is not linear. Allow mini-loops between bargaining and anger before he stabilizes into acceptance.
    

If this reads true, I can immediately:

- Convert it into a chapter-by-chapter beat sheet (10–16 chapters) with specific set pieces that map to each stage.
    
- Draft Mr. P’s parallel “temptation arc” so their alliance feels necessary, not convenient.
    
- Recalibrate Illana and Ge-orge’s roles around this spine (what each says/does to nudge him along without stealing his agency).

[[Illana]] Macbeth  
Illana is the party’s quiet compass—a realist who understands that all things end and that mercy sometimes looks like restraint rather than spectacle. She shares Lucian’s concern for others but is more disciplined about triage: her people come first, and the mission comes before strangers who would jeopardize them. Where Lucian blazes, Illana holds; her strength is steadiness. She is not colder or crueler—just less easily distracted, quicker to weigh consequences, and determined to choose the necessary over the dramatic. Illana’s abilities reflect that temperament. She is a necromantic cleric bound in secret to the god of death, working with shadow, stillness, and precise, morale-tilting magic that outmaneuvers foes rather than overpowering them. In the field she turns fights with timing, positioning, and surgical choices. Her loyalties are to Ezra and Lucian first, and to the mission as a close second; she treats Ge-orge with earned caution and a willingness to see what he does rather than what he claims. Illana’s bond with Lucian is the thread that keeps him from unraveling—until it snaps. Three-quarters through the story, she falls in battle. That death is the hinge of Book One: it breaks Lucian, exposes Ge-orge to real loss instead of abstract guilt, and redefines “saving Ezra” as something more complicated than bringing everyone home unchanged. Illana’s role is not to vanish for shock value; it is to be the example of courage without spectacle, and to remain present in memory as the measure by which the others find their way back to themselves.

[[George]] Jhonson  
Ge-orge begins as “The Blade Scholar, the Demon’s Scribe”—a celebrated archaeologist from the Iron Spire whose lifelong obsession with legendary swords corrodes into a pact with the power bound inside his own weapon. He does not pretend he was tricked; he wanted what the pact offered. The result is a ruthless, pragmatic man who treats companionship as logistics and morality as a luxury. His magic is demonic swordcraft: the weapon in his hand can absorb other blades, inheriting their styles and properties so he can switch seamlessly from heavy cleaver to curved duelist’s sabre to blunt crusher in the span of a few breaths. He fights like a front-line executioner who can also anchor a line when needed. Ge-orge’s first contact with Lucian is violent: in Stonehollow, Lucian mistakes him for a cult agent, provokes him in a tavern, and gets dismantled in the street as Ge-orge’s shifting blade parts fire and ends the duel without gloating. Ge-orge then introduces himself—not as a cultist but as an archaeologist tracking the same people and the same artifact, the Breaker Blade. He offers help because it saves him time, and because the party plainly needs someone who knows what he’s doing. That posture begins to bend as he travels with them: he still speaks in the grammar of utility, but loss and proximity thaw what remains of his conscience. His loyalties are initially to knowledge, to the next sword, and to his own survival. In practice, those loyalties start to rearrange themselves around the people beside him—first begrudgingly, then deliberately. Ge-orge’s role is not a sudden redemption but a slow, uneven shift from being a man who uses others to a man who, at critical moments, chooses them.

[[Ezra]] Phoenix  
Ezra is the axis around which the first book turns: mentor, guardian, and standard-bearer of the discipline she taught her children. In the Echoing Canyons she raises Lucian and trains him in fire with a combination of rigor and warmth that makes his morality feel lived-in rather than preached. She is not a symbol to them; she is home. Ezra is powerful—a master of fire magic—but her power is never the point. What matters is the way she teaches them to carry it. When she vanishes, the story’s quest framework snaps into focus: find Ezra. Her abduction introduces the antagonists and forces the party out of safety and into a world where ideals are expensive. When Lucian and Ge-orge finally reach the high chamber that holds her, she is physically present but mentally shattered: hunched, hair matted, eyes that do not register them, a faint protective shimmer around her as if someone sealed her off from the world. She does not recognize Lucian at first; she recoils more than she reaches. The rescue is not triumph but a reckoning. Ezra’s bonds to Lucian and Illana—bonds that anchor both of them—become a source of ache rather than comfort, and her fragmented state reframes what “saving” even means. Her role in the story is twofold: at the beginning, she is the spark that sends them out the door; at the end of Book One, she is the mirror that forces them to admit that not everything broken can be restored to what it was, and that love sometimes means living with what remains.

[[Mr P]] (Æthelric Padmavati)  
Mr. P is the patient hand behind the Iron Path—a scholar of the oldest magics whose obsession is stripped of theatrics and distilled to a single premise: do not die. He is not a grandstanding tyrant; he is a methodical engineer of survival who sees people the way a mathematician sees variables. Death in Eyum is final; a corpse animated by necromancy is not a life recovered, it is an instrument. That reality converts his fear into a program: bind spirits, suspend decay, rewrite what can be rewritten, and extract whatever a rare bloodline or singular talent can offer to keep the darkness off his heels. Ezra is targeted for this reason—not hatred or revenge, but utility. Mr. P rarely appears openly and almost never fights directly; when he does, his magic rots flesh, breaks enchantments, and rearranges the rules on which lesser casters rely. More often he is a rumor in a mask, a patron in an inn, a kindly scholar at the edge of a scene—present without announcing himself, measuring variables that do not yet matter to him until they do. His loyalties do not include followers; cultists and lieutenants are scaffolding. He lacks the delusions of empire. He wants what he cannot bear to lose, and he is willing to pay in strangers’ futures to purchase it. Mr. P’s role in Book One is the pressure that organizes events—the abductions and experiments that throw the heroes into motion. His role beyond is the temptation that organizes the survivor: when grief drives Lucian to consider forbidden paths, Mr. P’s obsession becomes a cautionary map of where such a path ends.

[[Kahn]] Steel  
Khan is the visible fist of the Iron Path—the Black Dog whose reputation for brutality is matched by a personal code that is as narrow as it is iron. He is the one who rips Ezra from her life and drags a trail of wreckage behind him without apology. He relishes the work and does not pretend it is anything nobler than power taken by force—but he also does not lie about it. Khan’s loyalties are simple: his own strength, the coin and glory that feed it, and, above all, his strike force. He does not betray his men and will kill for them or die with them. That code is twisted but real, and it makes him more than a faceless enforcer. In combat he is a walking warzone: a master duelist and brawler who weaponizes momentum and endurance, breaks magic by breaking the mage, and commands presence so thoroughly that his soldiers fight harder simply because he is watching. He is not a spellcaster, but he has learned how to unmake spellcasters through timing, pressure, and contempt for ornament. Khan’s bond to Mr. P is transactional—useful alignment, not faith. His bond to his men is possessive and absolute. His role in the story is to be the storm the protagonists must cross: the clear, immediate enemy whose trail leads them from village tremors to an obsidian fortress and a final duel that he refuses to avoid. He dies the only way he accepts living—on his feet, smiling, war in his hands—having served as both obstacle and measure of what the party must become to keep going.
