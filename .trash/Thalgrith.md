Appearance: Thalgrith is a colossal, slithering mass of slick violet-black flesh, covered in dozens of coiling tentacles that writhe independently, each tipped with jagged claws or blinking, alien eyes. Its body is marked with pulsating bioluminescent runes that shift constantly, never repeating, etched by forces not meant for mortal comprehension. A gaping, vertical maw splits its torso, ringed with countless rows of serrated teeth and emitting an oppressive hum that vibrates through both flesh and thought. Where it moves, the ground bends, cracks, and pulses as if the world itself resists its presence.
Disposition: Thalgrith is a living fragment of an unraveling reality, less a predator, more a consequence of forbidden knowledge manifest. It does not hunt, it draws its victims, warping the space around it until perception, time, and logic break down. Its attacks are as much mental as physical: pulling foes through collapsing dimensions, severing their connection to reason, and remaking the battlefield into an alien reflection of its own mind. Though intelligent, its thoughts exist on a scale and structure incomprehensible to most beings. Only thunderous disruption seems capable of cutting through the rift it brings with it.
