To keep combat streamlined, it's recommended to group players and enemies into blocks within the initiative order:

- Grouped Initiative: All players act together, followed by all enemies (or vice versa).
    
- Individual Initiative: Each combatant acts in strict order by their initiative roll.
    

Use grouped initiative for speed and simplicity, or individual initiative for tactical precision and dramatic tension.
