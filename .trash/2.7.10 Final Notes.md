- The GM is your guide and referee. They control the flow of the game and describe how the world reacts.
    
- The game works best when everyone contributes. Be creative, communicate clearly, and make choices in-character.
    
- You do not need to know every rule. The GM will help you and explain as needed.
    
- Dice rolls only happen when something is uncertain or risky.
    

You can try anything, the rules exist to support your choices, not limit them.
