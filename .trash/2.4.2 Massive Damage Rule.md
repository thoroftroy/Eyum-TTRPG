If you take damage equal to half or more of your maximum HP in a single hit, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10).

- On a failure, you are knocked unconscious until the end of your next turn or until you take damage again.
    
- On a success, you remain standing, but you have a -1 penalty to all attack rolls for the next turn.
