Optional content for campaigns that incorporate advanced technology. Introducing firearms, vehicles, or mechanical races changes the tone of a setting toward industrial, modern, or even futuristic themes. GMs should decide how widespread such technology is, whether it’s rare prototypes, restricted to certain cultures, or commonplace. Players must understand that guns, cars, and machines alter combat pacing and narrative tone. As with other expansions, GM approval is required.

#### Firearms

Firearms are divided into three broad eras of technology, each with distinct traits. Guns require ammunition, which may be limited or costly depending on the campaign. Unless otherwise noted, firearms are two-handed.

- Rifle: 4d8 Piercing, Range 120ft, Reload 1.
- Shotgun: 4d6 Piercing, Range 20ft (Cone), Reload 2.  
    Reload: Requires an Action to reload after listed shots are expended.

Modern Firearms

- Reloading: Listed Reload or Magazine rules apply. Reloading consumes an Action unless stated otherwise.
#### Vehicles
Vehicles represent a leap in player mobility, pursuit, and combat encounters. As with guns, their inclusion changes campaign tone. Vehicles may be rare luxury, common everyday tools, or war machines depending on setting.

#### Smogborn
Height: 5'2 - 6'4
Weight: 240 - 400 lbs
Lifespan: 200 - 350 years
Size: Medium
Speed: 30 ft
Language: Common

Description: Smogborn are entirely mechanical beings, their forms forged of brass, iron, and copper plates riveted over intricate gears and pistons. Within each chest burns a compact alchemical furnace, its steady heat powering their every motion. Their movements release faint hisses of steam or curls of smoke, and their voices carry the metallic resonance of vibrating chambers. Joints are reinforced with visible springs and rods, and their eyes glow with the steady light of internal ember-lamps. Fuel lines and maintenance hatches are built seamlessly into their frames, and their bodies smell faintly of oil and scorched metal. Though they may decorate themselves with etchings, rivet-work, and custom plating, their design is always functional first.

Culture: Smogborn were first created by ancient alchemists and runemasters seeking to fuse mechanical endurance with adaptive intelligence. Over centuries, they developed self-replication and repair, allowing them to grow as a people even without their original makers. Smogborn communities are often centered around shared forges and fuel stores, and trade heavily in metals, coal, and rare combustible materials. They see themselves as living engines of progress, valuing construction, industry, and tangible achievement. The act of maintaining one’s own body is seen as both a duty and an art form, with many Smogborn personalizing their plating or gearwork as a reflection of skill. Magic is viewed with suspicion, as it tends to interfere with their inner workings. Outsiders often find their constant smoke and scent of burning fuel oppressive, but among themselves, these are signs of vitality and health.

Other: Base AC is 17 + Dexterity modifier when unarmored. Disadvantage on all spell attack rolls and -2 to spell save DC. Immune to poison and disease. Must consume at least one pound of burnable fuel (wood, coal, oil, etc.) per day or gain one level of exhaustion. Can repair during a short or long rest by consuming 1 gp worth of raw metal to regain hit points equal to Constitution modifier × proficiency bonus, this is the only way for them to heal outside of spells or potions.
