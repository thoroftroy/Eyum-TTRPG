By default, The World of Eyum does not enforce strict carrying limits, players are generally free to manage their inventory without tracking weight. However, if the GM chooses to enable this optional rule, each character has a carrying capacity equal to:

20 × Strength Score 

This total includes all items, both equipped and in your inventory. If you exceed this limit, your character becomes encumbered, which causes:
- Disadvantage on all rolls
- Movement speed is halved
- You cannot pick up additional items
