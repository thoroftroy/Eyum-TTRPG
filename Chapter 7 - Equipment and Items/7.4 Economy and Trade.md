#### Bartering and Negotiation

- Items may be exchanged at a value agreed upon by both parties.
    
- Charisma-based skill checks (such as Persuasion or Deception) can influence prices.
    

#### Selling Loot

- Vendors buy items at 50% of their base cost unless the item is in high demand.
    
- Selling used items will make the value go down, the GM will determine how used the item is/what condition it is in. Generally a used item will sell for 80-90% less than the base cost. 
    

- If an item is usable but clearly has been used before it will sell at around 75-85% less
    
- If an item is mostly unusable but still has some material value it will sell around 86%-95% less
    
- Vendors will NOT always want to buy items, if an item is too damaged or the vendor simply doesn't want it they will not buy it. 
    

#### Currency & Exchange:

Money in Eyum is structured as follows:

• 100 Copper = 1 Silver

• 100 Silver = 1 Gold

• 100 Gold = 1 Platinum

• 100 Platinum = 1 Nerite

Regional variations may adjust prices and available coinage.

#### Using the Economy in Gameplay*

Economic mechanics are not merely a background detail but an active part of gameplay:

- Resource Management: Managing funds and resources is crucial. Players must balance spending on equipment, healing, and other necessities with opportunities for investment and profit.
    
- Downtime Activities: Between adventures, characters might engage in activities such as crafting, trading, or even running their own shops. These pursuits can offer both financial rewards and unique narrative experiences.
