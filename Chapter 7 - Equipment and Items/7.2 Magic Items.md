Magic items are rare and powerful tools created through enchantment, divine blessing, or ancient technology. Most are crafted by Runemasters or discovered in dangerous, long-forgotten places. All magic items fall into a tiered rarity system and follow the rules of rune-based customization.

  

For the most part you won’t have to worry about this section as a player because the GM will make most of the items. Come back to it if you want to actually try creating your own magical items. Otherwise all you need to care about is the Attuning section.

Note: A character can generally attune to 3 magic items at once unless otherwise stated. 

#### 7.3.1 Attuning

Attuning to a magic item allows you to use its effects and only one person can be attuned to an item at once. This means that the attuned item cannot be used or stolen by any other creature. Attuning takes 1 minute. You can un-attune an item at the cost of 5 vitality and 1 minute. 

#### 7.3.2 The Rune System

Magic items gain their effects from runes. Runes may be:

- Embedded during crafting
    
- Socketed into items with rune slots
    
- Inscribed onto surfaces or scrolls for temporary use
    

Example:

- Rune of Fire: Adds 1d4 Fire damage to attacks
    

Each rune type may be applied to specific item types:

- Weapons: Combat runes
    
- Armor: Defensive or reactive runes
    
- Accessories: Utility or resistance runes
    
- Consumables: Single-use burst runes (scrolls, bombs)
    

For more information on runes see the runemaster section of the handbook.
