Crafting and enchanting are integral parts of character progression and downtime. While adventuring provides treasure and gear, many of the most powerful items in Eyum are forged by player hands.

Crafting allows the creation of weapons, armor, gear, and runes using gathered resources and proper tools. The base crafting rules are as follows:

To Craft an Item:

- You must have:
    

- The relevant tools (e.g., Smithing Tools for weapons)
    
- A crafting space (forge, workshop, etc.)
    
- Materials of appropriate tier
    
- The required Craft or Arcana skill
    

- Roll 1d20 + Craft Affinity.
    
- The DC depends on item tier:
    

- Common: DC 10
    
- Uncommon: DC 15
    
- Rare: DC 25
    
- Very Rare: DC 30
    
- Legendary: DC 45+
    

- Crafting takes time based on complexity and rarity (see table below).
    

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Item Rarity|Time Required|Example Item|
|Common|4 hours|Basic sword, simple ring|
|Uncommon|1 day|Enchanted cloak, fire dagger|
|Rare|3 days|Runic weapon, bound armor|
|Very Rare|1 week|Elemental gear, relic trinkets|
|Legendary|1 month or quest|Artifact blade, divine item|

#### 7.4.2 Enchanting Basics

Enchanting embeds runes or direct magical effects into crafted items.

To Enchant an Item:

- Requires an Enchanter’s Kit, rune catalyst (material), and the item to be enchanted.
    
- You must roll Arcana + Intelligence against the enchantment DC:
    

- +3 per rune (e.g., 2 Runes = DC 13)
    
- +5 if the item is already magical
    

- The item must have open rune slots to embed a rune. Some rare materials provide extra rune capacity.
    

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Enchantment Type|Required Tool|Notes|
|Rune Embedding|Enchanter’s Kit|Adds effects like Fire, Speed, ect|
|Direct Infusion|Catalyst Stone|Rare method to grant passive traits|
|Soulbinding|Ritual Space + Totem|Binds item to character; often cursed (like attuning but cannot be undone and does not count towards attuning maximum)|

#### 7.4.3 Crafting Outcomes

Failing a crafting roll by more than 5 results in item failure and wasted material. Failing by less than 5 creates a flawed item (reduced effectiveness, added instability, or fragility).

Critical successes may create exceptional items:

- +1 to a stat or effect
    
- Extra rune slot
    
- Unique visual or reactive flair
