#### Stacking Effects
- If multiple effects grant the same type of bonus (for example, two spells that both increase AC), only the highest bonus applies unless an effect specifically states it can stack.
- Bonuses from different types of sources (such as a spell and a rune) can stack, as long as neither effect explicitly overrides the other.
- In practice, this means that natural armor and worn armor do not stack, two different AC-boosting spells do not stack, but a potion that raises AC and worn armor do stack.
#### Underwater Combat
Combat underwater functions differently due to resistance, visibility, and breathing limits. The following rules apply while fighting in submerged environments:

Movement:
- Creatures without a swim speed move at half their standard speed underwater.
- Wearing medium or heavy armor imposes disadvantage on swim checks.
- Dash and Disengage actions work normally, but terrain is always treated as difficult unless you have a swim speed.

Breathing:
- Characters without water-breathing abilities can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 1 + their Constitution modifier (minimum 1).
- After that, they begin suffocating (see 2.5.1 Conditions → Suffocating).

Attacks:
- Melee weapon attacks are made at disadvantage unless the weapon is:
- A dagger, spear, trident, or shortsword
- Or otherwise specifically adapted for underwater use (at GM discretion)
- Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss beyond their first range increment, and are made at disadvantage even within that range unless the weapon is thrown (e.g., javelin or dagger).
- Spells with verbal components cannot be cast unless the caster can breathe underwater or uses magic to bypass the requirement.
- Area-of-effect spells behave normally unless otherwise limited by the environment (e.g., fire-based spells may not work or deal reduced damage, this will happen at the GM’s discretion).

Visibility:
- Underwater vision is limited to 60 ft in clear water, or 30 ft in murky water.
- Darkvision works normally in water but does not improve clarity.
- Light-based spells only illuminate half their normal radius underwater unless specified otherwise.
