#### Stacking Effects
- If multiple effects grant the same type of bonus (for example, two spells that both increase AC), only the highest bonus applies unless an effect specifically states it can stack.
- Bonuses from different types of sources (such as a spell and a rune) can stack, as long as neither effect explicitly overrides the other.
- In practice, this means that natural armor and worn armor do not stack, two different AC-boosting spells do not stack, but a potion that raises AC and worn armor do stack.
#### Passive Perception
What It Is:  
Passive Perception is your character’s ability to notice hidden things without actively looking for them. It represents how alert or aware they are by default.

How It’s Used:  
The Game Master (GM) uses your Passive Perception to determine if you automatically notice things like:
- Hidden traps
- Sneaky enemies
- Subtle clues in the environment
You don’t roll for it, the GM just checks your score in the background. Your passive perception score is equal to 10 + Wisdom Modifier.
A higher Passive Perception means you’re more likely to notice danger before it’s too late, even when you’re not actively looking.
#### Inspiration
Inspiration is a special reward the GM can grant players for exceptional moments of roleplay, clever problem-solving, emotional depth, or creative actions that enhance the game.
The GM may award 1 point of Inspiration when a player:
- Deeply roleplays their character’s beliefs, flaws, or background.
- Solves a puzzle or problem in an especially creative way.
- Enhances the group’s enjoyment through immersion or storytelling.
- Impresses the table with a cool, cinematic moment.
There is no limit to how many times you can earn Inspiration, it is tracked as a tally, not a binary on/off switch. You can hold multiple points at once unless the GM sets a limit.
Inspiration may be spent to gain advantage on any d20 roll, standard advantage rules apply. 
You must declare that you are using Inspiration before the result of the roll is revealed, but you do not have to declare it before you roll.
Once spent, the point(s) are consumed.
#### Underwater Combat
Combat underwater functions differently due to resistance, visibility, and breathing limits. The following rules apply while fighting in submerged environments:

Movement:
- Creatures without a swim speed move at half their standard speed underwater.
- Wearing medium or heavy armor imposes disadvantage on swim checks.
- Dash and Disengage actions work normally, but terrain is always treated as difficult unless you have a swim speed.

Breathing:
- Characters without water-breathing abilities can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 1 + their Constitution modifier (minimum 1).
- After that, they begin suffocating (see 2.5.1 Conditions → Suffocating).

Attacks:
- Melee weapon attacks are made at disadvantage unless the weapon is:
- A dagger, spear, trident, or shortsword
- Or otherwise specifically adapted for underwater use (at GM discretion)
- Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss beyond their first range increment, and are made at disadvantage even within that range unless the weapon is thrown (e.g., javelin or dagger).
- Spells with verbal components cannot be cast unless the caster can breathe underwater or uses magic to bypass the requirement.
- Area-of-effect spells behave normally unless otherwise limited by the environment (e.g., fire-based spells may not work or deal reduced damage, this will happen at the GM’s discretion).

Visibility:
- Underwater vision is limited to 60 ft in clear water, or 30 ft in murky water.
- Darkvision works normally in water but does not improve clarity.
- Light-based spells only illuminate half their normal radius underwater unless specified otherwise.
