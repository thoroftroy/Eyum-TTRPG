Crafting produces physical items (weapons, armor, tools, wondrous frames). Enchanting adds or moves magical effects (runes, infusions). Both systems use the same core ideas:
- **Blueprint** (what you’re making or copying)
- **Materials** (the frame & additives that set stats and enchantability)
- **Tools & Workspace** (kits/benches that change DC/time)
- **Check Cycle** (rolls that build **Progress** toward a **Target**)
- **Quality** (outcome band: Flawed → Standard → Fine → Masterwork → Exquisite → Mythic)
- **Mishaps** (only on big failures, with explicit consequences)

> Ability & skill: When a step says **Craft(Tools, Ability)**, use the tool proficiency and the listed ability:  
> • Smithing Tools → **Craft(STR)**  
> • Tinker’s Tools → **Craft(DEX)**  
> • Alchemist Kit (for permanent infusions) → **Craft(INT)**  
> • Enchanter’s Kit (engraving runes) → **Arcana(INT)**  
> • Scribing Tools (scrolls) → **Arcana(INT)**  
> If you have a class/feat feature that improves “crafting” or “engraving,” add it as normal.
### Tools & Kits (material variants)

These set **engraving DC**, weight, and add riders. (Use the best piece in the set for the bonus.)

|Tool / Kit|Best Materials|Engrave DC|Weight Notes|Material Rider|
|---|---|--:|--:|---|
|**Smithing Tools**|Steel, **Nerite** (anvil), **Canyonstar**|10–18|×1.0–1.2|**Nerite anvil:** +2 to Sunder/Repair checks. **Canyonstar hearth plate:** −2 to Craft Mishap DC (safer).|
|**Alchemist Kit (vessels)**|**Voidglass**, Phoenixscale alloy, Nerite|**9–12**|×0.3–1.0|**Voidglass** vessels are **shatterproof vs magic**; **Phoenixscale** vials grant Fire-safe handling (no self-ignite on fails).|
|**Enchanter’s Kit**|**Ferroflux** frame, Canyonstar plate|**8–10**|×1.2/0.95|**Ferroflux frame:** **−2 DC** to any engraving you perform; **Canyonstar backer:** −1 DC to hold the lattice clean.|
|**Thieves’ Tools**|Steel, Runewood handles|12–15|×0.7–0.95|Runewood silent grips (advantage vs noise checks).|
|**Herbalist Kit**|Bronze, Runewood|12–14|×0.6–1.1|Bronze safe with acids; Runewood light.|
|**Tinker’s Tools**|Canyonstar, **Ferroflux**|**8–10**|×0.9–1.2|**Ferroflux sockets** accept +1 embedded rune for **gadgets** only.|
|**Scribing Tools**|Gold nib / Platinum feed|**10**|—|−1 DC to scroll scribing (smoother flow).|
|**Mason / Glassblower**|Obsidian, Canyonstar, **Voidglass**|9–12|—|**Voidglass** crucibles ignore thermal shock/backflow.|

> **Engrave DC** above is your **tool baseline** for Arcana (engraving) checks before material/complexity modifiers.

### Materials Reference (frames & stats)

Weapons/armor/tool **frames** take their base stats from the item tables. **Material** modifies weight, durability, AC/damage step, and **Engrave DC** (how hard it is to implant runes). Lower DC is _easier_ to engrave.

**Key terms**
- **Weight ×**: multiply listed weight.
- **Durability**: Sunder Threshold (ST) is the DC to break the item with a Sunder attempt; **Item HP** is how much structural HP it has if you track it.
- **Material Quality Bonus (MQB)**: a universal small bump applied to **weapon damage** and **armor AC** (see each row). MQB is deliberately conservative; most power comes from runes.
- **Engrave Mod**: add to your **final** Engrave DC (negative is good).
- **Rune Cap**: maximum rune slots the frame can safely carry **before** overload penalties (you can exceed with risk).
- **Special**: always-on rider of the material.

| Material           |     Tier | Weight × | Durability (ST / Item HP×) |      MQB (Weapons / Armor) | Engrave Mod | Rune Cap | Special                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------: | -------: | -------------------------: | -------------------------: | ----------: | -------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Copper**         |      Low |      0.9 |                  10 / ×0.6 |        −1 dmg step / −1 AC |          −0 |        1 | Soft; +1 to smith speed; corrodes (repair every 2 weeks in damp).                      |

| **Steel**          | Standard |      1.0 |                  16 / ×1.2 |            **+0** / **+0** |          +0 |        2 | Baseline you used everywhere.                                                          |
| **Ferroflux**      |      Odd |      1.0 |                  12 / ×0.9 |        −1 dmg step / −1 AC |      **−4** |        5 | _Worst combat metal, best enchantability._                                             |
| **Silvered**       |    Spec. |      1.0 |                  13 / ×0.9 |                  0 / −1 AC |          +1 |        2 | Counts as silver vs lycan/undead; on nat 1: hairline crack (repair).                   |

| **Platinum**       |    Spec. |      1.2 |                  14 / ×1.0 |                      0 / 0 |          −1 |        2 | Stable matrix for scrolls & foci.                                                      |
| **Runewood**       |    Light |      0.6 |                  12 / ×0.8 | bows +1 range band / −1 AC |          −1 |        3 | Living grain: advantage to engrave _Nature/Balance_ runes.                             |
| **Obsidian**       |    Glass |      0.8 |                   8 / ×0.6 |      +1 crit range / −2 AC |          −2 |        2 | Brittle: on attack roll 1–2, DC 12 to avoid chipping (−1 dmg until repaired).          |
| **Echostone**      |      Mid |      1.1 |                  18 / ×1.3 |                  0 / +1 AC |          −1 |        3 | Resonant: once/encounter echo a triggered **Armor** rune at half effect (free).        |
| **Canyonstar**     |      Mid |      1.0 |                  18 / ×1.3 |                  0 / +1 AC |      **−2** |        4 | “Clean lattice”: +1 success margin on engraving; best **enchantability** mid-tier.     |

| **Phoenixscale**   |     High |      1.0 |                  18 / ×1.2 |                  0 / +1 AC |          −1 |        3 | **Fire Resist** (armor); weapons add **+1d4 Fire (1/turn)**.                           |
| **Moltenheart**    |     High |      1.1 |                  18 / ×1.2 |                 +1 dmg / 0 |          −1 |        3 | **Ignite** on weapon crit (1d6 Fire, 2 rounds, CON 14 ends).                           |

| **Voidglass**      |    Spec. |      0.3 |                   8 / ×0.4 |                          — |          −3 |        2 | Vessel only: shatterproof vs magic; not for weapons/armor.                             |

**Damage Step**: stepping **down** turns 1d8 → 1d6, 1d10 → 1d8, 2d6 → 1d10, etc. Stepping **up** reverses it. Don’t step below 1d4 or above 1d12/2d6 without magic.
### Crafting: from blank to finished

**You need**: the **Blueprint**, correct **Materials**, a **Workspace**, the **Tools**, and time.
#### A) Determine DC and Target
1. **Pick Rarity Tier (frame)**  
    Use the base table (your earlier note). We’ll keep those and add complexity modifiers.

|Rarity|Base Craft DC|Base Work Units (WU) Target|
|---|--:|--:|
|Common|10|8 WU|
|Uncommon|15|16 WU|
|Rare|25|32 WU|
|Very Rare|30|64 WU|
|Legendary|45+|128 WU (or quest-gated)|
2. **Add Modifiers** (sum them onto the DC)
- **Material**: use **Material Engrave Mod** only for Enchanting; for **Craft DC**, use:  
    Copper −1, Bronze 0, Iron +1, Steel 0, Ferroflux +2 (it warps), Silver +1, Gold +2, Platinum +1, Runewood −1, Obsidian +1, **Echostone 0**, **Canyonstar −1**, **Voidsand +2**, **Phoenixscale 0**, **Moltenheart 0**, **Nerite +3**.
- **Size/Complexity**:  
    Light weapon/Small tool **+0**; One-handed weapon/Medium tool **+1**; Two-handed or Heavy armor **+3**; Shield/Medium armor **+2**.  
    Add **+1** per special property beyond default (e.g., Scythe “Finesse Two-Handed” counts as 1).
- **Workspace**: Field kit **+2 DC**; Proper shop **0**; Master forge/bench **−2 DC**.
- **Assistants**: One proficient helper grants **advantage** or **−2 DC** (choose one). Max 2 helpers.

**Example Craft DC** = Base (Rare 25) + Material (Canyonstar −1) + Size (Shield +2) + Workspace (Shop 0) = **DC 26**.

3. **Set the Work Unit (WU) Target**  
    Use base by rarity (table above). Professionals can split work over any number of days.
#### B) Work Cycle & Progress
- Each **Work Cycle** is **4 hours** of focused work. At the end, roll **Craft(Tools, Ability)** vs the **Craft DC**.
- On a **success**, you generate **Progress** = (check result − DC) **+ your proficiency bonus** (minimum **1 WU**).  
    On a **natural 20**, double the Progress from that cycle.  
    On a **fail by 1–4**, **0 WU** and gain **1 Fatigue point** (three Fatigue = Disadvantage on next cycle only).  
    On a **fail by 5+**, roll on the **Craft Mishap d12** (below), then **0 WU**.
- When your accumulated **Progress ≥ Target WU**, the frame is complete. Proceed to **Finishing** (polish, fit, quench)—takes **1 extra hour** (no roll).
#### C) Quality Band
Compare your **final cycle’s** margin of success and total success count:

| Quality                                                                           | Benefits                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flawed** (finished but you incurred ≥2 Mishaps, or final roll only just met DC) | −1 to item’s MQB effect (min 0). First Sunder check vs it gains +2.                                                                     |
| **Standard** (met DC with <2 Mishaps)                                             | As listed.                                                                                                                              |
| **Fine** (any cycle beat DC by **10+** at least once)                             | +1 **Durability ST**, +10% weight reduction (round to 0.1 lb).                                                                          |
| **Masterwork** (beat DC by **15+** once, or two cycles by **10+**)                | +1 to hit (weapons) **or** +1 AC (armor) **before magic**; +1 **Rune Cap** for **this frame only**.                                     |
| **Exquisite** (nat 20 **and** beat DC by **15+** in same cycle)                   | As Masterwork **and** choose: reduce future **Engrave DC** on this item by **2**, **or** add **+1 WU die** to any future upgrade on it. |
| **Mythic** (GM award; quest chain)                                                | Unique naming, story boons; treat as **Very Rare** chassis for enchanting caps even if the frame started lower.                         |

> **Rework:** You can re-temper a Flawed item: 1 cycle, DC −2; success upgrades to **Standard** (no other gains).

#### D) Craft Mishap (d12)

1 **Warped temper**: reduce Durability ST by 2 (can be re-tempered with 1 iron ingot, 1 cycle).  
2 **Hairline crack**: first crit against it forces Repair after combat.  
3 **Tool slip**: you take 1d6 damage; lose 1 hour (no roll).  
4 **Bad quench**: weapons −1 damage until re-quench (1 cycle); armor −1 AC until re-fit.  
5 **Material impurity**: +1 Engrave DC on this item only.  
6 **Loose fitting**: disadvantage on first Sunder check against it each day.  
7 **Surface pitting**: −1 to Persuasion/Value checks to sell (it looks rough).  
8 **Balance off**: −1 to hit (weapons) until you spend 1 cycle to rebalance.  
9 **Rivet pop / seam tear**: −1 Item HP× (down one step) until repaired.  
10 **Workspace scorch**: no helper bonuses next cycle.  
11 **Shattered insert**: lose 10% of your rare material by weight.  
12 **Minor explosion**: you and a helper take 1d6 Fire/Force; items safe.

### Upgrading, Repair & Sunder

**Repair** (same crafter or any smith)
- **Minor (cosmetic/edge)**: 1 hour, DC = original DC −5.
- **Functional** (lost MQB, hit penalty, seam): 1 cycle, DC = original DC −2.
- **Structural** (crack, broken guard): 2 cycles, DC = original.
- **Shattered**: 50% materials required; treat as **new** craft with **WU Target halved**.

**Sunder (combat)**  
To break: attacker declares a **Sunder** (uses an attack). On hit, roll opposed check vs **Durability ST**. On success:
- **Weapons**: **Dulled** (−1 dmg) → **Cracked** (−2 to hit) → **Broken** (unusable).
- **Armor/Shields**: **Dented** (−1 AC) → **Breached** (−2 AC) → **Broken** (no AC).  
    Repairs follow the tiers above. **Nerite** ignores non-Mythic Sunder effects.

**Material swap / Reforging**  
To upgrade a Steel piece to Nerite (for example), craft a **new frame** (same blueprint) and spend **1 extra cycle** to **transplant** fittings and any runes (engraving checks still required). If you have a **Runebinder’s Needle**, you can move runes safely 1/day.
###  Enchanting (Runes, Infusions, )

### A) Rune Slots & Caps
- **Base Rune Slots by item** (before material):  
    Weapons **1**; Shields **1**; Light Armor **1**; Medium **2**; Heavy **2**; Wondrous **1**; Staves **2**.
- **Material Rune Cap** modifies the **maximum safe** total (see Materials table). Exceeding the cap causes **Overload** (below).
- **Masterwork/Exquisite** crafting can add **+1 slot** (frame-only).
#### B) Engraving DC (exact math)
When adding or moving a rune, roll **Arcana(INT)** using your Enchanter’s Kit.
**Engrave DC = 10 + 3×(Total runes after this one) + Item Magic Step + Material Engrave Mod + Workspace Mod + Complexity Mod**
- **Item Magic Step:** Common 0, Uncommon **+2**, Rare **+4**, Very Rare **+6**, Legendary **+8**.
- **Material Engrave Mod:** from Materials table (e.g., Ferroflux **−4**, Nerite **+3**, Canyonstar **−2**, Voidsand **+1**, Steel **0**).
- **Workspace:** Field **+2**, Bench **0**, Master Enchantry **−2**.
- **Complexity Mod:** Rune **Tier 1/2/3/4/5** adds **+0/+2/+4/+6/+8**. Nerite allows **+1 Max Rune Tier** on that item.
- **Tool perks:** Ferroflux **Kit Frame −2**, Canyonstar plate **−1**, Runesmith’s Chisel: advantage or −2.

**Success:** rune sits, immediate effect.  
**Fail by 1–4:** no slot consumed; you may try again after 1 hour.  
**Fail by 5+ (Surge):** roll **Enchant Mishap d12** (below). The attempt consumes 50% of the rune’s catalyst value.

**Time:** Each engraving attempt takes **1 hour** per rune tier (T1=1h, T3=3h, etc.).
#### C) Overload & Stabilizers

Going **over the item’s Rune Cap** adds **+4 DC per extra rune** and risks **Overload** each long rest: roll Arcana DC **15 + 2×(excess runes)**. On fail, one random rune **goes dormant** for 24h and the item takes **Stress** (−1 to Engrave attempts on it) until repaired (1 hour, DC 12).

**Stabilizers** (consumed on use):
- **Eclipticorb:** negate **one** Mishap roll **or** remove **two** Stress stacks from the item.
- **Canyonstar powder (trace)**: **−1 Engrave DC** for this attempt (stacks once).
- **Ferroflux paste:** allows **moving** a socketed rune to a new slot on the **same item** without re-rolling (once per item/day).
#### D) Enchant Mishap (d12)

1 **Backfeed**: you take 2d6 Force; rune fails.  
2 **Scorch lines**: +2 Engrave DC on this item for 24h.  
3 **Polarity flip**: rune inverts for 1 hour (e.g., Fire → Cold).  
4 **Dormant**: all runes on this item disable for 10 minutes.  
5 **Hairline lattice**: −1 Rune Cap until repaired (1h DC 14).  
6 **Wild spark**: trigger a random **Tier-1** rune effect in 10 ft (GM pick from your lists).  
7 **Anchoring slip**: rune sits but at **−1** to its DC/attack until re-set (1h DC original −2).  
8 **Overheat**: you gain **1 Exhaustion** unless CON 14.  
9 **Bleedthrough**: nearby ally takes 1d6 of the rune’s damage type (if any).  
10 **Static lock**: you cannot attempt engraving for 1 hour.  
11 **Rune drift**: rune shifts slot; if no free slot, it pops out (salvage 50%).  
12 **Minor fizzle**: nothing happens; you may immediately retry at **+2 DC** or stop.
#### E) Direct Infusions (permanent passives)
Instead of a standard rune, you can stitch a **Catalyst** into the frame (e.g., Phoenixscale, Moltenheart, Voidsand). Use **Craft(INT)** with **Alchemist Kit** **or** **Arcana** with Enchanter’s Kit (your choice).
- **Infusion DC** = 12 + Material Engrave Mod + Item Magic Step
- **Time** = 2 hours (Phoenixscale/Moltenheart), 3 hours (Voidsand), 4 hours (Nerite channel), unless the catalyst says otherwise.
- **Effect examples**:  
    • **Phoenixscale:** Fire Resistance (armor) or +1d4 Fire (weapons, 1/turn).  
    • **Moltenheart:** Ignite on crit (weapons) or +1 Fire AC (armor).  
    • **Voidsand:** −1 to incoming spell attack rolls vs wearer; enables **Anti-Magic** rune without extra DC.  
    • **Nerite Dust (bound):** +1 Max Rune **Tier** on this item (stacks once).  
    • **Echostone shard (bedded):** armor echoes a **triggered** rune once/encounter at half effect.

Fail by 5+: roll **Enchant Mishap**.
#### F) Disenchanting & Salvage
- **Pop a Rune**: **Runebinder’s Needle** (1/day, no roll) or Arcana DC **15 + Rune Tier**; success salvages the rune intact; fail by 5+ loses it (50% catalyst back).
- **Grind to Dust**: spend 1 hour; regain **50–75%** of the catalyst value; frame unaffected.
- **Strip a Frame**: to reuse a Nerite/Voidsand frame, spend 2 hours, DC 15; success clears Stress and residual enchantment trace.
#### Time, Costs, and Materials
**Material Units (MU)**: abstracted weight/volume of the main metal/medium.

|Frame|MU|
|---|--:|
|Light weapon / small tool|2 MU|
|One-handed weapon / shield / medium tool|4 MU|
|Two-handed weapon / large tool|8 MU|
|Light armor suit|6 MU|
|Medium armor suit|10 MU|
|Heavy armor suit|14 MU|

- **Rarity surcharge** (if the blueprint itself is rarer than mundane): Uncommon +25% MU, Rare +50%, Very Rare +75%, Legendary custom/quest.
- **Costs**: If you track coin, price each MU of material by scarcity (Copper 1, Bronze 2, Iron 3, Steel 5, Silver 15, Gold 50, Runewood 6, Obsidian 4, Echostone 20, Canyonstar 25, Voidsand 60, Phoenixscale 80, Moltenheart 80, Nerite 120). Kits/benches are separate.

**Assist & Pace**
- You can work **2 cycles** (8h) safely per day. A third cycle inflicts **1 Exhaustion**.
- 1–2 trained helpers cap at the bonuses stated earlier (advantage or −2 DC each; pick).
### Examples (complete, step-by-step)

### EX1) Canyonstar **Shield** (Rare frame) → Rune of Protection (T2)
- **Blueprint**: Shield (base stats from 7.1).
- **Material**: Canyonstar (Engrave −2; Craft DC −1; Rune Cap +4).
- **Rarity**: Rare (better fittings, improved straps).
- **Craft DC**: Base 25 + Material (−1) + Size (Shield +2) + Workspace (Shop 0) = **26**.
- **WU Target**: 32.
- **Work**: You roll 29, 26, 31 over three cycles with proficiency +4. Progress = (3 + 4) + (0 + 4) + (5 + 4) = **20 WU**. You need **12** more; fourth cycle you roll 28 → (2 + 4) = 6; fifth cycle 33 → (7 + 4) = 11 → **37 WU total** (done).
- **Quality**: one roll beat DC by 7, one by 5; **Fine** ⇒ +1 ST and −10% weight.
- **Engrave**: Add **Protection (T2)**. **Engrave DC = 10 + 3×(1) + Item Step + Material (−2) + Workspace 0 + Tier +2** = 10 + 3 + 4 − 2 + 0 + 2 = **17**. You roll Arcana 20 ⇒ success.
- **Result**: Shield with +1 AC from **Fine**, **Rune: Protection** as written in your Affinity list, ST baseline +1, weight −10%.
### EX2) **Nerite Full Plate** (Very Rare) with **Anti-Magic (T3)** and **Voidsand** infusion
- **Craft DC**: Base 30 + Material **Nerite +3** + Size Heavy +3 + Workspace Master Forge −2 = **34**.
- **WU Target**: 64. (Expect 8–10 cycles; you planned a week.)
- If you achieve **Masterwork**, you’ll also get +1 AC and +1 Rune Cap.
- **Engrave #1 (Anti-Magic, T3)**: Engrave DC = 10 + 3×(1) + Item Step (Very Rare +6) + Material **+3** + Workspace −2 + Tier **+4** = **24**.
- **Engrave #2 (Voidsand infusion)**: DC = 12 + Material +3 + Step +6 = **21** (Craft(INT) or Arcana).
- **Overload**: Nerite Cap 4; Heavy base 2; Masterwork +1 → safe up to **5 runes**; you only used 2—no Overload.
### EX3) **Steel Longsword** → Upgrade to **Voidsand Alloy** and move the **Fire rune**
1. Craft a new Voidsand frame (Uncommon fit): Base 15 + Material +2 + Size +1 = **18**, target 16 WU.
2. **Transplant** (1 extra cycle, DC 15) to move guard/pommel/grip onto the new frame.
3. **Move rune** with **Runebinder’s Needle** (1/day): no roll. Otherwise Arcana vs DC from the Engrave formula.
### Optional: Batch Crafting & Ammo
- **Batch** (arrows, bolts, darts): treat 20 pieces as **1 frame** at Uncommon DC; on finish, roll Quality once for the batch.
### Quick Reference
- **Craft DC** = Base by rarity ± Material (craft) ± Size/Props ± Workspace (±2) (helpers: advantage or −2).
- **WU Target** = 8/16/32/64/128 (Common→Legendary).
- **Progress per cycle** = (roll − DC) + proficiency (min 1). Nat 20 = double progress.
- **Engrave DC** = **10 + 3×runes total + Item Step (0/2/4/6/8) + Material Engrave Mod + Workspace (±2) + Tier (0/2/4/6/8)**.
- **Overload** = +4 DC per extra rune; nightly Overload check DC 15 + 2×excess; on fail: 1 rune dormant + Stress.
- **Stabilizers**: **Eclipticorb** cancels one Mishap / removes 2 Stress; **Canyonstar dust** −1 DC; **Ferroflux paste** moves a rune in-item once/day.
