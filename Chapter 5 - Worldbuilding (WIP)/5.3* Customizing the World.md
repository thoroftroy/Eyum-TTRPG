#### 5.3.1 Adapting for Different Tones

Even if a tone was established in Session 0, players might not fully grasp or enjoy it once the game begins. If your group starts roleplaying in a drastically different tone than expected, it's okay to adapt. For instance, you may have planned a grimdark survival game, but if all your players create goofy characters, forcing them into a serious tone might not work. That said, a contrast between a serious world and comedic characters can be interesting if executed well.

#### 5.3.4 Homebrew Rules and Content

You are free to homebrew any rules or content in The World of Eyum as long as the players are aware of and agree to the changes. Homebrewed spells, monsters, and races can spice up both roleplaying and combat, allowing for a more personalized and unique experience.
