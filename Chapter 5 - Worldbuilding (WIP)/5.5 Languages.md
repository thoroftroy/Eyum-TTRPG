#### Standard Rule
You know:
- Your racial language (not all races have one)
- Common, the shared language of most people; you know this even if your race entry doesn’t list it
- +1 bonus language per 10 Intelligence, rounded down (e.g., INT 10-19 = 1 bonus language, INT 20-29 = 2 bonus languages, etc)

**Communication limits.** You can only understand, read, write, or speak languages you know. Without a shared language, only simple gestures or magical effects (like _Comprehend Languages_) work.
#### Language Catalog
Each language will eventually be fully functional, however, at the moment, I don't know how to add special characters and haven't made entire dictionaries. Sense all languages are in some form based on Auric, when a language doesn't have a word in it the language will often just use the Auric word for it.
