The World of Eyum does not exist in isolation. It is part of a vast, layered cosmology made up of interconnected dimensions known as planes of existence. These planes overlap, conflict, and bleed into each other, sometimes subtly, sometimes catastrophically. Understanding these realms is essential for worldbuilding, magic lore, and the nature of gods, demons, and the soul.

Planes are not necessarily physical locations; they are states of reality with their own laws, inhabitants, and magical traits.
### The Material Plane (Eyum)
The Material Plane, also called the World of Eyum, is the foundational layer of existence where matter and magic coexist in balanced tension. It is the realm of mortal life, linear time, and physical laws, where stone falls, fire burns, and the arcane obeys learned structure. Every civilization, creature, and story begins here, and the majority of adventures take place within its boundaries. It is neither the highest nor lowest of the planes, but it acts as the anchor to which all others are bound. Magic functions predictably here, shaped by ritual, emotion, and effort. Creatures that inhabit the Material Plane include mortals, natural beasts, most monsters, and artificially created constructs. The gods, though born or ascended from higher realms, often focus their influence here through dreams, omens, or empowered servants. Souls originate in the Material Plane and may reincarnate, pass into judgment, or be lost to other planes depending on their death and spiritual alignment. While it appears stable, the veil between this plane and others is thin in certain regions, ancient ruins, wild magic zones, or sites of immense tragedy may act as natural rifts or echo chambers, allowing bleed-throughs from deeper realms. In such places, light may flicker without cause, memories may linger unnaturally, or weather may reflect unseen forces. Though the Material Plane feels grounded and physical, it is constantly shaped by the whispers of the unseen cosmos pressing in from beyond.
### The Nyxrealm (Shadow Plane)
The Nyxrealm is a layered, distorted echo of the Material Plane, a half-formed shadow world built from memory, sorrow, and forgotten truths. It mirrors the real world imperfectly: structures exist where buildings once stood, forests flicker where dreams of trees remain, and cities manifest as hollow shells of long-lost moments. Everything here is dim, colorless, and weighed down by silence. Time flows strangely, perception warps under emotional stress, and light struggles to persist. The Nyxrealm is not inherently evil, but it is deeply unnatural, shaped by what is absent more than what is present. It is inhabited by strange entities born from emotion and memory, Nyctaris, whispershades, lost souls, and predators that feed not on flesh but on attention, identity, or unresolved grief. Travelers here may find themselves pursued by fragments of their own past, or forced to relive memories made manifest in haunting, distorted form. Entry into the Nyxrealm is possible through certain rituals, artifacts, or locations where grief, neglect, or longing have left deep psychic scars. Some dreamwalkers and cursed beings can slip between it and the waking world, though often at great cost. Visibility is low, color is absent, and sound carries farther than it should. Magic tied to illusion, mind, and necrosis grows stronger here, while divine light and healing may falter. While most visit only by accident or misfortune, a few powerful beings build strongholds within the Nyxrealm, protected by layers of unreality and illusion. To linger too long here is to risk becoming part of it, a hollow imprint, remembered only by shadow.
### The Aether (Celestial Plane)
The Aether is the sacred realm of the gods, a sealed and untouchable plane where only divine beings may reside. It is a place of flawless harmony and eternal brilliance, utterly separate from the mortal experience. Unlike other planes, the Aether is not accessible through magic, ritual, or death; no spell opens its gates, and no soul ascends here unless already divine. It is beyond comprehension, immune to corruption, and closed to all lesser beings. The Aether is not shaped by terrain or time, but by absolute purpose, its nature defined by the divine minds that dwell within it. Though the gods may gaze into the lower planes from their radiant thrones, they cannot directly enter them without unraveling the fabric of reality; their will must instead manifest through omens, avatars, emissaries, or sacred artifacts. The Aether does not echo or reflect the Material Plane, it transcends it entirely. Within its boundaries, the gods commune, contend, and shape the great metaphysical truths that ripple outward into the cosmos. Mortals who claim to have seen the Aether speak in riddles or madness, for its nature defies linear thought. There is no travel to the Aether. There is no breach, no gate, no key. It is the untouched origin, the unreachable summit, and the eternal domain of those who define the laws of existence itself.
### The Infernum (Infernal Plane)
The Infernum is the plane of monstrosity, chaos, and corruption, a furnace of raw creation where demons, aberrations, and nightmare entities are born in endless, shifting violence. It is often mistaken for a version of hell, but there is no punishment or judgment here, only transformation. No souls arrive in the Infernum upon death, for in Eyum, death is the end. The Infernum is not a destination for the wicked, but a breeding ground for horrors. Its landscapes are fluid and hostile: burning chasms, bone forests, living fortresses, rivers of bile, and impossible geometries that collapse under observation. The laws of nature do not apply here, gravity shifts, time fractures, and reality itself groans under the weight of ceaseless, unnatural births. Creatures spawned here are shaped by hate, hunger, instinct, or ancient curses, never by reason. These entities sometimes claw their way into the Material Plane through unstable rifts, summoned rituals, or moments of extreme magical disruption. The Infernum is not evil in the moral sense, it is simply alien, a realm where suffering and conflict are natural forces like wind or gravity. Mortal minds that glimpse it are often broken by the sheer wrongness of its logic. While some warlocks and cursed bloodlines trace their origins to pacts formed through the Infernum, no one truly controls this place. It is the crucible of monstrosity, the raw subconscious of the cosmos, where nightmares have flesh and survival is creationâ€™s only law.
### The Void (Plane of Non-Being)
The Void is not a place in the traditional sense, it is the absence of place, a hollow expanse beyond reality where form, meaning, and existence itself unravel. It is utterly silent, airless, and lightless, untouched by time or life. There are no stars, no ground, no sky, only an endless black that neither resists nor welcomes. This is where things go when they are truly erased. Destruction spells, consumption abilities, and ancient magic that claims to "remove" something from existence do not annihilate it, they send it here. Pocket dimensions that collapse, items consumed by entropy magic, and souls severed unnaturally from all realms may fall into the Void. Once there, they drift aimlessly in an endless vacuum, stripped of context and connection. At the center of this emptiness dwells an ancient and unfathomable entity known only in whispers as The Nothing, or the Black Maw of Oblivion. It does not move or speak, but its presence is felt across the planes in moments of perfect loss. Anything it swallows ceases to be known by memory or name, and it hungers not out of malice, but as a law of its existence. Escape from the Void is nearly impossible, there are no landmarks, no gravity wells, no breathable air, and no natural exit points. But in theory, a being with sufficiently powerful magic could tear a hole in its edge and slip free, provided they are not first consumed by the Maw. Nothing grows here. Light does not carry. Even gods cannot gaze into it without risking the loss of something they did not realize they cherished. The Void is not the end. It is what comes after the end, if anything dares remain.
### The Dreamscape (Mental Plane)
The Dreamscape is a surreal, ever-shifting plane formed from the collective mental energy of all living things, a subconscious overflow where thoughts, fears, memories, and imagination take on physical form. It is not entered by walking, but by slipping, through dreams, meditations, psychic ruptures, or magical accidents. Once inside, nothing follows the laws of the waking world. Geometry is unstable, time bends under emotion, and perception itself becomes a force that reshapes reality. Spells and monsters do not behave as they do elsewhere; instead, they manifest through interpretation. A fireball may erupt as a swarm of burning butterflies, or vanish entirely if the caster subconsciously doubts their control. Entities here are not born, they are believed into existence. If enough people fear something, it gains shape in the Dreamscape. If that fear persists, it gains power. Some nightmares grow so potent they develop agency and seek to influence the material world from beyond sleep. Other dream-beasts are fragments of collective guilt, longing, or wonder, drifting aimlessly until called upon by a stray thought. The plane itself resists mapping. Distance is subjective, landmarks rearrange themselves, and doors may lead to entirely different lives. The Dreamscape is beautiful and perilous, a realm where desire can heal or destroy, and where a lie believed too deeply can become a predator with teeth. It is not inherently evil, but it is profoundly dangerous. To survive here is to master your own mind, or be consumed by the minds of others.
### The Elemental Tides
The Elemental Tides are a massive, planet-like plane suspended in the firmament of existence, formed entirely from pure, living elemental energy. Divided into four immense hemispheres, each quadrant represents one of the primal forces: fire, water, earth, and air. These are not symbolic territories, but overwhelming, inhospitable realms where the raw essence of each element dominates absolutely. Oceans without floor stretch endlessly in the water hemisphere, where pressure crushes intruders and beasts of salt and current roam freely. The fire hemisphere is a roaring world of magma, sunfire, and endless combustion, where flame is sentient and mountains bleed heat. The earth quadrant is a continent of moving stone, crystal caverns, and titanic beasts of iron and ore. The air domain stretches in every direction with churning winds, floating isles, thunderous vortexes, and creatures born of storm and current. At the edges where these hemispheres meet lies the most unstable region of the plane: a massive, eternal storm where the elements clash and merge violently. These borders are in constant war, earth breaks upon flame, fire is drowned by wave, water evaporates to mist, and air screams across all in a storm of chaos. Elementals summoned to the Material Plane originate from these realms, shaped by their homelandâ€™s intensity and the will of the summoner. Each hemisphere is ruled by its respective elemental deity, beings of vast power who rarely speak and never leave their domain, content to sculpt their world in solitude or command their armies in the storm-wars along the borders. Time is unstable within the Tides, and travelers must brace against terrain that resists even magical intrusion. Nothing here was built by mortal hand, and nothing welcomes mortal presence. It is a realm of raw nature, untempered by civilization, where survival itself is a test of balance.
#### 5.4.1 Cross-Plane Travel
Plane travel is rare and difficult. Most spells that interact with other planes (e.g., Summon Fiend, Planar Shift) require:
- GM permission
- Powerful magicÂ 
- A stable rift, ritual site, or anchor

The planes are often closer than they appear. A cursed object or an ancient temple may blur the veil between worlds. The Game Master is encouraged to use planar influence as narrative flavor or major plot threads.
