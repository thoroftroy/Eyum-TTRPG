#### 5.2.1 Hooks and Plots

Story hooks can be simple: give players something they want or make it difficult for them to obtain anything at all. Motivations vary, some players seek wealth, others power, and some just want to explore. While “save the world” stories are classic, they aren’t always necessary. You can have overarching events unfold in the background, letting players decide whether they want to get involved. If they ignore the growing threat and the world ends, that’s on them.

#### 5.2.2 NPCs and Villains

NPCs and villains should be memorable and, if possible, recurring. It’s no fun to introduce an interesting character only for the players to kill them off or leave without any further interaction. Pay attention to how your players respond to certain NPCs, if they take an interest in someone, consider bringing that character back later. A recurring villain or rival can make for a compelling ongoing conflict, adding stakes to the story.

#### 5.2.3 Rewards and Treasures

Rewards should reflect the players' achievements. If they put significant effort into something, they should be compensated, whether with a powerful artifact, gold, or even a level-up. While XP systems provide structure, the most important thing is that players have fun. As the GM, you can adjust rewards as needed to keep the game balanced and engaging.
