#### 5.1.1 Geography and Regions

A key part of any roleplaying game is exploration. As a Game Master, it can be difficult to keep track of all the places players have visited. To maintain consistency and help players navigate, it's a good idea to create a map and track their movements. This ensures that locations remain coherent and memorable throughout the game.

#### 5.1.2 Factions and Organizations

Recurring factions and organizations can add depth to your world and make encounters more meaningful. For example, a mysterious cult that players encounter early on might later reveal itself to be a major force, creating a full-circle moment in the story. Having established factions gives players a sense of continuity and allows for more dynamic storytelling.

#### 5.1.3 History and Lore

You don’t need an extensive history or deep lore to create a compelling story. While well-developed lore can enhance immersion, you can also let players fill in the blanks with their imagination. Sprinkle hints and vague details throughout the game and allow them to speculate, sometimes, their ideas can be more interesting than what you originally planned. If something resonates with them, you can develop it further over time without needing to build an entire world in advance.

#### 5.1.4 Reputation and Factions

Reputation is a measure of how well-known and well-regarded a character is by specific groups, factions, or regions. Factions are organized groups, governments, guilds, religions, or cultures with goals and influence across the world of Eyum.

##### Tracking Reputation

Every character begins with 0 reputation with all factions unless the GM specifies otherwise. Reputation can range from -100 (hated) to +100 (revered).

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Reputation Score|Status|Typical Reactions|
|-100 to -51|Enemy|Kill on sight, active sabotage|
|-50 to -11|Hostile|Denied services, attacked if provoked|
|-10 to +10|Neutral|No special recognition or reward|
|+11 to +50|Friendly|Better prices, favors granted|
|+51 to +100|Revered|Free gear, access to secrets, political clout|

Reputation should be recorded per faction on the character sheet in the “Reputation/Factions” section.

##### How Reputation Changes

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Action Type|Example|Typical Rep Change|
|Complete a mission for a faction|Delivering supplies, defending an outpost|+5 to +25|
|Betray or harm a faction|Stealing from a vault, attacking a member|-10 to -50|
|Public deed affecting a faction|Killing a known enemy, desecrating a temple|±5 to ±30|
|Propaganda or diplomacy|Persuasive speech, performing for a crowd|±1 to ±10|
|Long-term support|Donating funds, sending supplies|+2 per session|

##### Faction Mechanics

Factions may provide boons or impose penalties based on your standing with them:

- Boons: Access to faction shops, divine blessings, special runes, unique gear, or mercenary support.
    
- Penalties: Increased encounter difficulty, denied entry, bounty hunters, assassins, cursed items.
    

Some factions may oppose each other, gaining rep with one may lower it with a rival (e.g., aiding rebels may lower standing with the kingdom).
