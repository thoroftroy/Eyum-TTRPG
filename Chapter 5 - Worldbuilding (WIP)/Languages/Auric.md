## 1) Phonology

### 1.1 Vowels (phonemes and length)
Auric uses five core vowels with phonemic length. Rare diphthongs are noted at the end.

|IPA|Romanization|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|/a/|a|open, as in father|
|/e/|e|mid-front, as in they but shorter|
|/i/|i|close-front, as in machine|
|/o/|o|mid-back rounded, as in note but shorter|
|/u/|u|close-back rounded, as in rule|
|/aː eː iː oː uː/|ā ē ī ō ū|long vowels (marked with macron)|
|(rare) /ai au/|ai au|allowed only in open syllables and never word-final|
**Allophony:**
- Unstressed /e/ may centralize slightly [ə] in fast speech; writing does not change.
- /i/ → [j] before another vowel across morpheme boundaries.
### 1.2 Consonants

|IPA|Romanization|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|/p b t d k g/|p b t d k g|plain stops; no aspiration contrast|
|/f s ʃ h v z ʒ/|f s sh h v z zh|fricatives|
|/m n ŋ/|m n ng|ng appears only before /k g/ or word-final|
|/l r/|l r|r is a tapped [ɾ] in most positions|
|/w j/|w y|glides|
|(affricate) /ts/|ts|occurs in a few native morphemes and many compounds|
**Phonotactics:**
- Canonical syllable shapes: (C)(C)V(ː)(C).
- Onsets allow a single consonant, or clusters {pr, br, tr, dr, kr, gr, pl, bl, kl, gl, fl}.
- Codas allow {m, n, ng, l, r, s, sh}.
- No word begins with ng.
- Diphthongs (ai, au) only in open syllables and never as the final syllable of a word.
### 1.3 Stress & Prosody
- Default stress: **penultimate** syllable.
- If the final syllable contains a **long vowel**, stress shifts to **final**.
- In compounds, each member keeps its original stress (secondary stress audible).
- Poetic register favors **quantitative meter** (long vs short vowels), not stress counts.
## 2) Script (Monumental Auric Capitals)
**Direction:** left→right. **Case:** a single monumental “capital” style—no lowercase. **Glyph count:** 22 letters + macron and punctuation. **Tools:** broad-nib or chisel; strokes prefer straights and shallow arches (no tight curves).
### 2.1 Letter Set & Romanization
Below, each entry gives a **shape description** (for carving/writing), **name**, **value**, and **romanization**. Use a square notional grid (□) to picture placement.
1. **Aru** — /a/ (a) — □ two verticals joined by a mid-bar; shallow roof arch.
2. **Eru** — /e/ (e) — □ single vertical with high bar and short right hook.
3. **Iru** — /i/ (i) — □ tall vertical with dot-mark above (carved as a short notch).
4. **Oru** — /o/ (o) — □ rectangle with small central void (punched square).
5. **Uru** — /u/ (u) — □ vertical with bottom bowl (flat), short right spur.
6. **Pa** — /p/ (p) — □ vertical + right half-box.
7. **Ba** — /b/ (b) — □ vertical + left half-box.
8. **Ta** — /t/ (t) — □ T-cross with lowered crossbar.
9. **Da** — /d/ (d) — □ vertical + small diamond to right.
10. **Ka** — /k/ (k) — □ angular < shape touching stem.
11. **Ga** — /g/ (g) — □ angular > shape touching stem.
12. **Fa** — /f/ (f) — □ vertical with forked upper bar.
13. **Sa** — /s/ (s) — □ zig stroke centered on stem.
14. **Sha** — /ʃ/ (sh) — □ triple scratches on right of stem.
15. **Ha** — /h/ (h) — □ open gate: two posts + lintel (no fill).
16. **Va** — /v/ (v) — □ chevron under short stem.
17. **Za** — /z/ (z) — □ zig with tail notch.
18. **Zha** — /ʒ/ (zh) — □ triple scratches on left of stem.
19. **Ma** — /m/ (m) — □ three short uprights on common base.
20. **Na** — /n/ (n) — □ two short uprights on common base.
21. **Nga** — /ŋ/ (ng) — □ base bar + rear hook.
22. **Ra** — /r/ (r) — □ short stem + rightward flag.  
    **Glides:** **W** and **Y** are written with **Va**+**Uru** and **Iru**+y-notch respectively; in transliteration use **w** and **y**.

**Macron for vowel length:** a straight **overbar** across the vowel glyph (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū). In stone, length is marked by a shallow **roof cap**.
### 2.2 Punctuation & Spacing
- **Word divider:** centered dot • (in manuscripts, a narrow space).
- **Clause divider:** short double wedge ‹›.
- **Sentence end:** square stop ◼.
- **Name marker:** small triangle ˄ preceding proper names in formal inscriptions.
### 2.3 Numerals
Decimal system with distinct digits (□ strokes resembling stacked bars). Ordinals are written by adding a small right-flag to the numeral.
## 3) Morphology
### 3.1 Nouns: gender, number, case
- **Gender:** animate vs inanimate (affects some pronouns and agreement).
- **Number:** singular, plural, collective. Collective denotes a set treated as one (e.g., “the council”).
- **Cases (6):** Nominative (NOM), Accusative (ACC), Genitive (GEN), Dative (DAT), Locative (LOC), Instrumental (INS).

**Core endings** (after a consonant):

|Case|Singular|Plural|Collective|
|---|---|---|---|
|NOM|-a|-im|-or|
|ACC|-en|-em|-or-en|
|GEN|-os|-um|-or-os|
|DAT|-ei|-ein|-or-ei|
|LOC|-in|-ith|-or-in|
|INS|-ta|-tash|-or-ta|

**After a final vowel** (a/e/i/o/u), drop that vowel before adding endings (e.g., _luma_ “light” → GEN _lum-os_).

**Adjectives** precede nouns and agree in **number** and **case** (not gender). Adjective endings mirror noun endings except GEN uses -es.

_Example:_ **barak** “mountain” (inanimate)  
NOM.SG: **barak-a**, GEN.SG: **barak-os**, LOC.PL: **barak-ith**.
### 3.2 Pronouns (personal)

|Person|NOM.SG|ACC.SG|GEN.SG|DAT.SG|NOM.PL|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|**an**|**mena**|**amos**|**amei**|**anim**|“I / we”|
|2nd|**ti**|**tina**|**tios**|**tiei**|**tim**|“you / you(pl)”|
|3rd anim.|**sar**|**sena**|**sos**|**sei**|**sim**|“he/she/they(anim.)”|
|3rd inan.|**or**|**oena**|**os**|**oei**|**oim**|“it/they(inan.)”|
**Reflexive:** **sva** (all persons), declines like adjective.  
**Demonstratives:** **ha** “this”, **ka** “that” (decline like adjectives).
### 3.3 Determiners & Articles
No definite/indefinite articles. Definiteness is expressed with demonstratives or word order.

### 3.4 Sandhi (sound changes at morpheme edges)
- Final **n** + following **k/g** → **ng** (spelled **ng**).
- A vowel + **i** + vowel across morphemes → **y** (e.g., _dae-i-os_ → _day-os_).
- A vowel + **u** + vowel across morphemes → **w**.
### 3.5 Derivation
- **Agentive:** -**ar** (e.g., _durg_ “to carry” → _durg-ar_ “bearer”).
- **Instrument:** -**ta** (often identical to INS case).
- **Abstract:** -**eth** (from adjectives/nouns).
- **Diminutive:** -**el**; **Augmentative:** -**gor**.
- **Collective:** -**or** (already in number).
## 4) Verbs
### 4.1 Overview
- **Conjugation classes:** A (stem ends in vowel), B (stem ends in single consonant), C (stem ends in cluster).
- **Tense/Aspect:** Present (PRS), Past (PST), Future (FUT); Imperfective (IPFV) vs Perfective (PFV).
- **Mood:** Indicative, Imperative, Subjunctive.
- **Voice:** Active, Middle, Passive (synthetic passive via suffix).
- **Agreement:** Person/number with NOM subject.
### 4.2 Endings (Active, indicative)
Attach to the **aspect-tense marker** (see 4.3) or directly to the stem in simple present.

|Person|SG|PL|
|---|---|---|
|1|-**a**|-**im**|
|2|-**i**|-**it**|
|3|-**u**|-**un**|
### 4.3 Aspect-Tense markers
- **Imperfective:** **-na-** (ongoing, habitual).
- **Perfective:** **-ta-** (completed, bounded).
- **Past:** **-e-** (placed after aspect; if no aspect, directly after stem).
- **Future:** **-u-** (same placement).

**Order:** stem-(aspect)-(tense)-agreement.  
If both aspect and tense appear: **stem-aspect-tense-agreement** (e.g., _lar-na-e-a_).
### 4.4 Middle & Passive
- **Middle:** add **-ri-** before person ending: _lar-na-e-ri-a_ “I was speaking for myself/with involvement.”
- **Passive:** add **-sha-** before person ending: _lar-ta-e-sha-u_ “it was spoken.”
### 4.5 Negation
Particle **ne** immediately **before the verb complex**: _ne lar-a_ “I do not speak.”  
Prohibitive (negative imperative): **ma** + verb infinitive: _ma lari!_ “do not speak!”
### 4.6 Subjunctive
Marker **-ye-** inserted before agreement: _lar-ta-ye-u_ “that he speak (successfully).”  
Used in purpose clauses, wishes, and some conditionals.
### 4.7 Copula (“to be”)
- Simple present is **zero** in equatives: _an durgar_ “I (am a) bearer.”
- Past/future or emphatic uses **es-**: _es-e-u_ “he was,” _es-u-un_ “they will be.”
### 4.8 Infinitive & Participles
- **Infinitive:** **-i** (class A), **-u** (class B/C) → _lari_ “to speak,” _durg-u_ “to carry.”
- **Active Participle:** **-an** (IPFV), **-at** (PFV) → _lar-an_ “speaking,” _lar-at_ “having spoken.”
- **Passive Participle:** **-esh** → _lar-esh_ “spoken.”
### 4.9 Sample Conjugations
**Class A (vowel stem):** _lar-_ “speak”
- PRS.1SG: **lar-a**

## 5) Syntax
### 5.1 Word order
Default **SOV** (Subject–Object–Verb). Adjectives precede nouns. Genitives precede head nouns. Adpositional system mixes **prepositions** for motion and **postpositions** for static relations (conservative layer).
### 5.2 Clause types
- **Yes/No question:** sentence-final clitic **-a?** after the verb, or particle **qa** initial.
- **Content questions:** interrogatives fronted: **mi** who, **mae** what, **kath** where, **len** when, **sai** why, **kya** how.
### 5.3 Relative clauses
Introduced by **ke** immediately before the clause; verb final as usual:  
_barak-a ke an lari sim_ “the mountain that I speak of (they) know.”
### 5.4 Focus & Topic
Focused constituents may appear clause-initial with particle **sa-**; topic marked by **ha** after the topic phrase.
### 5.5 Comparison
- **Comparative:** adjective + **-es** + **genitive standard**: _gor-es an-os_ “stronger than me.”
- **Superlative:** prefix **mar-** on adjective: _mar-gor_ “strongest.”
### 5.6 Possession
Possessor in **GEN** immediately before possessed: _amar-os luma-a_ “the light of the temple.”
### 5.7 Numerals
1 **an**, 2 **du**, 3 **tri**, 4 **qat**, 5 **pen**, 6 **shes**, 7 **sep**, 8 **ok**, 9 **nev**, 10 **des**.  
11 **des-an**, 20 **du-des**, 100 **sent**, 1000 **mir**.  
Ordinals add **-ith**: _du-ith_ “second”.
## 6) Core Lexical & Functional Items (for fluency without dictionary)
**Pronouns/particles:** an, ti, sar/or; ne (neg), qa (Q), ke (REL), sa- (FOC), ha (TOP), ma (PROH).  

**Common adpositions:**
- **prepositions (motion):** _to_ “to(ward)”, _over_, _under_, _into_ (writes as _en-to_), _from_ (ab).
- **postpositions (static):** _-ko_ “at/on,” _-ran_ “among,” _-dul_ “within.” (Attach after LOC case or as separate words.)

**Everyday verbs:**
- _lar_ speak, _durg_ carry, _es_ be, _ven_ see, _kar_ make, _ten_ give, _mor_ go, _sed_ sit, _lum_ shine, _der_ take.

**Nouns for practice:**
- _luma_ light, _barak_ mountain, _amar_ temple, _saran_ person(anim.), _tor_ stone, _nath_ river, _mer_ day, _nos_ night.
## 7) Usage Examples (with gloss)
1. **An luma-en ven-ta-e-a.**  
    I light-ACC see-PFV-PST-1SG.  
    “I saw the light.”
2. **Saran-a amar-os ko sed-na-a.**  
    person-NOM temple-GEN at sit-IPFV-1SG.  
    “I am sitting at the temple.”
3. **Ne mor-u-im barak-in.**  
    NEG go-FUT-1PL mountain-LOC.  
    “We will not go to the mountain.”
4. **Mi saran-a qa ven-a?**  
    who person-NOM Q see-1SG?  
    “Whom do I see?” (lit. “Who is the person that I see?”)
5. **Durg-ta-e-u tor-en saran-a.**  
    carry-PFV-PST-3SG stone-ACC person-NOM.  
    “The person carried the stone.”
6. **Mar-gor-es sar-os.**  
    SUP-strong-COMP 3SG.ANIM-GEN.  
    “Stronger than him/her.”
7. **Barak-a ke ti ven-ta-e-i sim.**  
    mountain-NOM REL you see-PFV-PST-2SG they.ANIM.NOM.PL  
    “They are the ones who saw the mountain you saw.”
8. **Ma lari!**  
    PROH speak.INF  
    “Do not speak!”
## 8) Register & Style
- **High Auric** (ritual, law): favors long vowels and perfective aspect; avoids contractions and diphthongs; uses full case marking.
- **Common Auric** (vernacular/late): allows syncope of unstressed vowels, reduced case on inanimates (often GEN and DAT collapse to **-os**, **-ei** only in names/titles).
## 9) Learning Path (no dictionary yet)
1. Memorize the **22 letters** and macron length mark; copy five example inscriptions with ◼ stops.
2. Drill **case endings** with 10 nouns (mix consonant/vowel finals).
3. Conjugate **lar-** and **durg-** across PRS/PST/FUT, IPFV/PFV, then add negation and subjunctive.
4. Compose 10 SOV clauses, then add **ke** relatives and **qa** questions.
5. Practice **numerals** and **ordinals** describing dates and counts.
