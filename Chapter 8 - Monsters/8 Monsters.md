Note: Players generally don’t need to read this section, these stat blocks are used by the GM. If you're curious about how monsters are built or want to design your own later, you can revisit this part. If you want a general understanding just read through 8.1 and 8.2.1-8.2.2.



Monsters in The World of Eyum are the creatures, entities, and horrors that populate the world. They range from wild animals and corrupted abominations to celestial beings and eldritch horrors. Monsters serve as adversaries, obstacles, and even potential allies, depending on the context of an encounter.

Monsters in Eyum follow the same core mechanics as player characters but are built differently, using simplified stat blocks for ease of play. Their attributes, abilities, and behavior depend on their lore, classification, and purpose within an encounter.

Below is a list of all monsters currently in the TTRPG; This is very much a WIP and likely missing half of the monsters.
