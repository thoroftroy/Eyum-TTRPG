Monsters in Eyum are created to fit the story, environment, and combat balance. This section will guide you in designing monsters with appropriate stats, abilities, and behaviors.
##### Step 1: Define the Monster’s Role
Before designing stats, determine the monster’s function:
- Brute: High HP/Vitality, strong melee attacks, lower speed.
- Glass Cannon: High damage but weak defenses.
- Tank: Extremely high AC or resistances, moderate damage.
- Support: Buffs allies, inflicts debuffs, manipulates the battlefield.
- Boss Monster: Combines multiple traits, may have legendary actions or phase-based mechanics.
##### Step 2: Assign Base Stats
Monsters do not follow player stat allocation rules. Instead, use the following guideline:
Base Attributes by Challenge Rating

| CR    | Strength | Dexterity | Constitution | Intelligence | Wisdom | Charisma |
| ----- | -------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ | -------- |
| 1-5   | 8-14     | 8-16      | 10-18        | 4-12         | 6-14   | 6-14     |
| 6-10  | 12-20    | 12-22     | 14-24        | 6-18         | 8-18   | 8-18     |
| 11-15 | 16-26    | 14-26     | 18-30        | 10-22        | 10-22  | 10-22    |
| 16-20 | 20-30    | 16-30     | 20-35        | 12-26        | 12-26  | 12-26    |
| 21+   | 24-40    | 20-40     | 24-50        | 16-30        | 16-30  | 16-30    |
##### Step 3: Determine HP, Vitality, and AC
- HP & Vitality = Base Constitution × CR modifier
- Armor Class (AC) = 10 + Dexterity Modifier + natural armor (if applicable)

| CR    | HP Formula | Vitality Formula | AC Range |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| 1-5   | 1d8 x CR   | 2d6 x CR         | 10-15    |
| 6-10  | 2d10 x CR  | 3d8 x CR         | 12-18    |
| 11-15 | 3d12 x CR  | 4d10 x CR        | 14-22    |
| 16-20 | 4d12 x CR  | 5d12 x CR        | 16-25    |
| 21+   | 5d20 x CR  | 6d20 x CR        | 18-30    |
##### Step 4: Attack Damage and Abilities
The base damage of a monster should scale based on its CR.
##### Melee Damage Scaling:
- CR 1-5: 1d6 to 2d10
- CR 6-10: 2d10 to 4d12
- CR 11-15: 4d12 to 8d10
- CR 16-20: 8d12 to 12d10    
- CR 21+: 12d12 to 20d20
##### Special Abilities:
- Breath Weapons: A cone or line attack with elemental damage.
- Auras: Passive area effects, such as Fear, Poison, or Fire.
- Spellcasting: If applicable, monsters may have innate spells based on their Intelligence or Affinity.
- Reactions & Counters: More advanced monsters can counterattack when hit.
##### Step 5: Resistances, Weaknesses, and Immunities
Some monsters have additional defenses against damage types:
- Physical Resistance: Halves non-magical damage.
- Elemental Affinity: Resistance or vulnerability to Fire, Water, Air, or Earth.
- Magic Resistance: Advantage on saving throws against spells.
- Legendary Resistance: High-CR monsters can choose to succeed a failed saving throw (limited uses per day).
##### Step 6: Behavior
Decide how the monster fights:
- Aggressive: Rushes enemies head-on.
- Cunning: Uses terrain and tactics.
- Defensive: Soaks damage while allies attack.
- Unstable: Uses chaotic, unpredictable abilities.
#### 8.2.1* Monster Variants
Not all monsters are created equal, even among creatures of the same species. Some may be weakened by age, curse, or damage. Others may be empowered by divine favor, magical mutations, or simply the rigors of survival. To accommodate greater flexibility and narrative depth in encounter design, monsters may be modified using variant modifiers.
These modifiers allow a GM to scale a monster’s Combat Rating (CR) up or down to match the challenge level of a party, regardless of its base species or intended threat. This system is ideal for adapting lower-level monsters into high-level fights or using powerful creatures in weakened states.
Each modifier adjusts the creature’s stats, abilities, and CR to reflect its enhanced or diminished power. These changes are applied after the base statblock has been created, and may be combined with creature leveling (see 8.2.2).
Important: A monster’s species does not limit its potential power. These modifiers provide mechanical support for scaling threats while maintaining consistency with the creature's origin and lore.
##### Variant Modifiers Table

| Modifier  | CR Change | Mechanical Changes                                                                                         |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lesser    | -2        | -20% HP/Vitality, -2 to all stats, -1 attack/damage rolls, loses 1 special ability (if applicable).        |
| Weakened  | -1        | -10% HP/Vitality, -1 to all stats, loses legendary actions if any.                                         |
| Cursed    | -1        | Immune to healing, gains one random debuff (e.g., frightened at start of combat), -1 to all saving throws. |
| Standard  | ±0        | No change from base statblock.                                                                             |
| Elite     | +1        | +10% HP/Vitality, +1 to all stats, one extra use of a limited ability.                                     |
| Greater   | +2        | +25% HP/Vitality, +2 to all stats, gains a minor passive effect (e.g., regenerate 2 HP/turn).              |
| Mythic    | +3        | +50% HP/Vitality, +3 to all stats, gains a second phase at 0 HP (returns at half HP).                      |
| Ancient   | +3        | +60% HP/Vitality, immune to 1 damage type, gains +2 AC, +2 to saving throws, +1 Ap                         |
| Corrupted | +2        | +75% HP/Vitality, Deals +1d8 necrotic/psychic damage on all attacks, but takes +25% damage from radiant.   |
| Awakened  | +4        | +100% HP, +4 to all stats, +2 Ap                                                                           |
Using Variant Modifiers
- Application: Apply modifiers before a combat encounter. They are not intended to fluctuate mid-battle.
- Stacking: Only one modifier should be applied per monster.
- Narrative Use: Encourage flavor integration. A Greater Vintershade might be the clan leader.
#### 8.2.2* Monster Leveling
While Challenge Rating (CR) determines a monster’s base threat, GMs may sometimes want to feature familiar monsters at higher or lower threat levels without replacing their species. The Monster Leveling system provides a flexible method to scale existing monsters up or down while preserving their identity and narrative role.
This allows a CR 3 creature like a Mirewretch to reappear as a CR 13 version in a higher-tier adventure, using expanded stats and more dangerous abilities.

Note: This system is optional and should be used alongside 8.2.1 Variant Modifiers when appropriate. It does not replace the core CR guidelines used for stat creation and balance.

##### How It Works
Monster Leveling adjusts a creature’s CR by reassigning stats, recalculating HP/Vitality, and optionally granting additional abilities. This does not alter the monster’s core behavior or species traits, it simply reflects a more powerful or weakened version of the same creature archetype.
When leveling a monster:
- Use the monster’s current CR as a base.
- Apply the new CR's stat block ranges as defined in 8.2 Step 2 (Strength, Dexterity, etc.).
- Recalculate HP and Vitality using the CR-appropriate formulas from Step 3.
- Increase damage output and ability scaling in accordance with Step 4’s CR guidelines.
- Adjust AC, resistances, and number of abilities if desired to match the new power level.
##### Design Notes
- When leveling a monster, treat it as a “template” that gets rebuilt with higher CR values, not as a simple numerical scaling.
- You may add new abilities, legendary actions, or passives as the CR rises, but keep the monster’s core theme intact.
- If used in combination with 8.2.1 Variant Modifiers, apply modifiers after leveling is complete.
- GMs are encouraged to record leveled variants separately for reuse.
