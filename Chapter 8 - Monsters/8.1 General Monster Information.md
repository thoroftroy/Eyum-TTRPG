#### 8.1.1 Monster Roles in the World

Monsters in The World of Eyum exist for multiple reasons:

- Wild Creatures: Beasts, natural predators, and magical wildlife that roam the world, often hostile when threatened.
    
- Corrupt Entities: Beings tainted by chaos, void, or dark magic, often aggressive and unnatural.
    
- Celestial or Infernal Beings: Creatures tied to divine or hellish planes, often powerful and with strong ideological ties.
    
- Eldritch Horrors: Entities beyond mortal comprehension, frequently causing insanity, fear, or corruption upon interaction.
    
- Constructs & Undead: Artificial beings or reanimated corpses, often controlled by magic, a necromancer, or ancient forces.
    
- Humanoid Opponents: Bandits, mercenaries, dark cultists, and rival factions who pose threats to players.
    

#### 8.1.2 Combat and Mechanics

Monsters are fought using the same combat system as players, but their actions are controlled by the Game Master. Unlike players, monsters do not use traditional classes, feats, or leveling systems. Instead, their stat blocks are designed based on their Challenge Rating (CR) and role in battle.

##### Turn Structure

1. Initiative: Monsters roll Initiative and take turns like any other combatant.
    
2. Actions & Abilities: Monsters take their turn, using abilities, attacks, and reactions based on their stat block.
    
3. Vitality & Health: Monsters typically have Vitality (Vit) acting as temporary stamina before they start taking actual Health (HP) damage.
    
4. Defenses & Resistances: Many monsters have unique resistances, vulnerabilities, or immunities to elements, physical attacks, or status effects.
    

##### Attack Types

Monsters attack using one or more of the following methods:

- Melee Attacks: Claws, bites, weapons, tentacles, etc.
    
- Ranged Attacks: Spit, thrown weapons, projectiles, breath weapons.
    
- Magic & Abilities: Some creatures cast spells, use auras, or have unique supernatural effects.
    
- Reactions & Legendary Actions: Some powerful monsters can act outside their turn, responding to player actions with counterattacks or defensive moves.
    

##### Threat Scaling & Challenge Ratings (CR)

Monsters are categorized by Challenge Rating (CR) to determine their difficulty:

- CR 1-5: Low-level creatures, minor threats, small beasts.
    
- CR 6-10: Mid-level threats, dangerous beasts, trained warriors, lesser demons.
    
- CR 11-15: Advanced creatures, powerful warlords, lesser eldritch horrors.
    
- CR 16-20: Near-boss-tier monsters, divine beings, demon lords, ancient dragons.
    
- CR 21+ (Legendary/Boss-Level): World-ending threats, supreme eldritch entities.
    

#### 8.1.3 Pacts?

If a monster has a CR of 15+ then a warlock can form a pact with it, the abilities you will gain from this pact will be much weaker than a deity pact but will still allow you to take warlock levels without using deities. The monster you form a pact with will get stronger as you get stronger. The abilities they grant are decided by the Game Master.Â 

  

Note: These monster pacts should be generally weaker than a pact with a Feind or other deity.
