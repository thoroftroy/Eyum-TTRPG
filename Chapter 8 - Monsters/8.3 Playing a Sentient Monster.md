Sometimes the coolest “race” for your character is… not a race at all, but a monster. That’s allowed in Eyum, with guardrails. Treat this as a collaborative option: you (the player) and your GM co-design a Monster Race Package that plays nicely with the world, the party, and the rules.

  

TL;DR: Start small (low CR), build it with your GM, and expect a little homebrew to make the stat block work at the table.

#### 8.3.1 Table Rules & Baselines

- GM Approval Required. You must build your monster with the GM. The GM may say no to specific monsters or features that won’t fit the campaign’s tone, balance, or logistics.
    
- Start Low-CR. At level 1, you may choose low-CR monsters only (GM’s discretion). Remember that the monsters CR is like their level, so if you will be starting at level 1 in the campaign you should be playing a CR 0 or 1 monster. 
    
- Sentience & Speech. If your Intelligence score is below 4, your character cannot speak any language (you can still growl, chirp, gesture, etc.). You also cannot learn or use spoken languages until your Intelligence reaches 4+. If the monster has telepathy or species-specific communication, the GM decides how (or if) that helps. However, sense your monster is more sentient than the average variety you may raise your intelligence if the GM see’s fit. 
    
- You’ll Homebrew It. Monster stat blocks aren’t plug-and-play as PC races. Expect to adapt, trim, and translate features into player-facing mechanics. That’s normal.
    

#### 8.3.2 How to Build a Monster Race Package (with your GM)

Work through this checklist together. When in doubt, pick the simpler version.

A) Anatomy & Basics

- Size: Use the monster’s size. Remember size rules (reach, squeezing, grappling, equipment fit).
    
- Speed: Keep the listed land speed.
    

- Other movement modes (climb, swim, burrow) are allowed if the monster has them.
    

- Languages: If the stat block lists none, you start with no languages. You may learn languages normally if INT ≥ 4. Otherwise, you’re limited to sounds/gestures/instinctual signals.
    

B) Ability Score Adjustments

- As a race package, pick at most +4 total across up to two stats and −2 total across one or two stats to reflect monster physiology (GM may tweak).
    

- Example: Wolf (+2 DEX, +2 WIS, −2 INT).
    

- This replaces the typical point buy system.
    
- Affinity functions normally but consider all affinities as neutral unless otherwise listed in the monster’s statblock. 
    

C) Senses

- Keep special senses (darkvision, blindsight, tremorsense) as written for range, unless the GM reduces ranges to fit table expectations.
    

D) Natural Armor & AC

- If the monster has natural armor, set AC = 12 + DexMod (light hide) or 14 + DexMod (max +2) (heavy hide), whichever fits the stat block’s intent. Heavy hide may interfere with some gear (GM call).
    

E) Natural Weapons

- Convert attacks into simple natural weapons you’re proficient with:
    

- Light bite/claw/tail: 1d4
    
- Medium bite/claw/tail: 1d6
    
- Heavy slam/gore/large bite: 1d8
    

- Damage type matches the monster (slashing/piercing/bludgeoning).
    
- They count as weapons for rules that care (feats, spells, maneuvers), and can be used with Attack actions.
    

F) Multiattack → Player Turn Economy

- Eyum uses AP/BAP/RP. Translate Multiattack as:
    

- Once per turn, if you take the Attack action with a natural weapon, you may spend 1 BAP to make one additional natural weapon attack (no more than +1 this way at level 1).
    
- At character level 5, this improves (GM options): either reduce the BAP cost to 0 once/turn or allow a second BAP attack (still capped at +1 extra unless the GM approves more).
    

G) Resistances, Immunities, & Vulnerabilities

- Keep one standout durability feature at level 1 (resistance to X, or immunity to a narrow environmental effect, etc.).
    
- Additional resistances/immunities become locked traits you can earn later as you level up, the specific levels which grant which resistences/immunities is up to the GMs discretion. 
    

H) Equipment & Body Plan

- Nonhumanoid bodies complicate gear. Decide what slots you have (head, neck, chest, back, “bracers,” rings, etc.).
    
- Custom harnesses/armor cost 2× and require a craft check or specialist. Some items may be unusable. That’s part of the fantasy, price it in, don’t ignore it.
    

I) Drawbacks

- You will always gain all drawbacks unless they would provide a massive hindrance in which the GM may rule that you don’t have them. 
    

#### 8.3.3 Social & Story Expectations

- Session Zero: Talk about how a visible monster moves through towns, temples, and guard posts. Will you hide? Wear a cloak? Be infamous? This matters.
    
- Spotlight Sharing: Your form will create scenes (good and bad). Make sure that attention adds to the party’s fun, not steals it.
    
- Consequences: Guards may panic. Druids might try to tame you. Villains could mistake you for an ally. Lean into it, Eyum rewards bold choices.
