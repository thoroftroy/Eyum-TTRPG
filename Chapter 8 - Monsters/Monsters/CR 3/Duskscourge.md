- **Appearance:** The Duskscourge is a serpentine horror woven from shadow, with slick, ink-black scales that drink in all light. Its eyes glow dimly violet beneath a translucent membrane, and its form blurs at the edges, as if never fully part of this world. Its body twists with unnatural grace, rippling like smoke when it moves and leaving behind faint trails of darkness that dissipate seconds after contact. When it opens its mouth, its fangs gleam silver, and a low hissing hum fills the air like whispered curses.
- **Disposition:** Duskscourges are predatory nightmares that haunt the liminal places between light and dark, cave mouths at dusk, temple ruins during eclipse, or forest borders at moonrise. They are clever and patient, often stalking prey unseen for hours before striking from the shadows in a blur of fangs and gloom. Their connection to the void allows them to bend space briefly, slipping through darkness to close the distance or evade harm. While not truly evil, they embody fear, and feed on the psychic residue of terror and uncertainty. Where light dies, they thrive.
