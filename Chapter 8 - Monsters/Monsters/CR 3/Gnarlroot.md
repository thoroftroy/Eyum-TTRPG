- **Appearance:** The Gnarlroot is a towering, humanoid tree-being formed from ancient, twisted bark and moss-choked limbs. Its "face" is a cracked, bark-covered knot that shifts subtly as it moves, and its limbs creak with the weight of centuries. Roots dangle from its torso like tattered robes, and small sprouts, fungi, and insects often live along its shoulders and back. Despite its bulk, the Gnarlroot can move with uncanny silence, blending into forests as though it were just another part of the land.
- **Disposition:** Gnarlroots are ancient wardens of the wild, slow to act but devastating when provoked. They are deeply territorial, protecting sacred groves, old-growth woods, or druidic ruins with unshakable determination. Though not clever by mortal standards, they understand fear, balance, and reverence for the land. Those who respect the forest may pass unnoticed, but those who desecrate it will find themselves ensnared by living roots and crushed beneath mossy fists. In sunlight, they draw strength from the canopy above, slowly healing even the deepest wounds with the patience of growing things.
