Appearance: A Mirewretch is a bloated, waterlogged corpse animated by foul necrotic magic and steeped in the rot of centuries-old swamps. Its skin hangs in tatters, green with algae and streaked with dark mud, sloughing off in places to reveal muscle and bone that pulses with unnatural life. Its eyes glow a sickly green, casting an eerie shimmer across the water when it surfaces. The creature emits a constant stench of sulfur, stagnant water, and decay, trailing pieces of marsh flora as it lumbers forth.
Disposition: Drawn to the warmth of the living, Mirewretches lie submerged for hours or days, waiting in total stillness beneath the swamp's surface. When prey passes, they erupt with surprising speed, dragging victims down into the muck for a slow and painful death. They possess only the most rudimentary intelligence, enough to stalk, to grasp, to kill. Often found near cursed ruins, drowned villages, or gravewaters tainted by foul rituals, Mirewretches act as both predators and pollution. Their embrace carries the chill of the grave, and even seasoned hunters speak of feeling a hollow dread when the waters go silent.
