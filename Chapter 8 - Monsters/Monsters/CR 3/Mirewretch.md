- **Appearance:** A Mirewretch is a bloated, waterlogged corpse animated by foul necrotic magic and steeped in the rot of centuries-old swamps. Its skin hangs in tatters, green with algae and streaked with dark mud, sloughing off in places to reveal muscle and bone that pulses with unnatural life. Its eyes glow a sickly green, casting an eerie shimmer across the water when it surfaces. The creature emits a constant stench of sulfur, stagnant water, and decay, trailing pieces of marsh flora as it lumbers forth.
- **Disposition:** Drawn to the warmth of the living, Mirewretches lie submerged for hours or days, waiting in total stillness beneath the swamp's surface. When prey passes, they erupt with surprising speed, dragging victims down into the muck for a slow and painful death. They possess only the most rudimentary intelligence, enough to stalk, to grasp, to kill. Often found near cursed ruins, drowned villages, or gravewaters tainted by foul rituals, Mirewretches act as both predators and pollution. Their embrace carries the chill of the grave, and even seasoned hunters speak of feeling a hollow dread when the waters go silent.

**Abilities**
- **Putrid Claws.** Melee Attack: +4 to hit, 1d10+2 necrotic damage.
- **Swamp Lurker.** The Mirewretch can remain motionless and hidden in murky water, remaining undetectable without magical means.
- **Deathly Embrace (1/day).** If the Mirewretch successfully grapples a target, the victim takes 2d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns until freed (escape DC 12).
- **Death Burst.** When the Mirewretch is reduced to 0 HP, it explodes in a surge of swamp rot. All creatures within 15 ft must make a DC 13 CON save. On a failure, they take 2d6 necrotic, 2d6 poison, and 2d6 acid damage. On a success, they take half damage. If multiple Mirewretches die within range of one another, their Death Bursts will chain react. Death Burst will not happen to a Mirewretch killed with Radiant damage.
