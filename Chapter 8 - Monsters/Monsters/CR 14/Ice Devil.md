- **Appearance:** Chitinous, insectile frame sculpted from blue-white ice; wings like shattered windows rimmed in hoarfrost. Its spear is a glacier shard bound in iron wire; breath fogs into snow-flakes that hang, unwilling to fall.
- **Disposition:** Officer of winter sieges. It shapes the field with walls of ice, pins prey with spearwork precise as drill, and punishes warmth—torches, campfires, courage alike. If outmatched, it peels the fight into splinters with mirror-slick floors and leaves enemies separated, shivering, and easy to collect.
