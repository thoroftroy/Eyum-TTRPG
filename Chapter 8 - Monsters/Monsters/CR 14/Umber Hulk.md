- **Disposition:** Disorientation engine. It breaks line of sight with a wall of earth, bursts out at a right angle with a roar that rattles teeth, then deletes one target before the party’s bearings return.

- **Confusing Gaze (Recharge 5–6).** All creatures of choice within 30 ft that can see the Umber Hulk must make a DC 72 Wisdom save or become Confused for 2 turns (as the _confusion_ effect). On a success, they instead have Disadvantage on attacks until the end of their next turn.
- **Earthshaper (Passive).** Whenever the Umber Hulk burrows, it can collapse tunnels behind it as a free action, creating difficult terrain or blocking paths.
- **Burrow Ambush (Recharge 6).** The Umber Hulk erupts from the ground at a point within 60 ft, forcing all creatures within 20 ft to make a DC 72 Dexterity save or take 10d12 Bludgeoning and be knocked Prone. On a success, they take half damage and remain standing.
