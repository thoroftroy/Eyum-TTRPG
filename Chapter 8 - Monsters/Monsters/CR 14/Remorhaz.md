Appearance: A furnace-backed centipede whose plates glow from coal-red to white-hot along the spine. Frost hisses to steam where it passes; snow caves into slush beneath its many clawed legs. Scarred segments show where blades melted into the chitin and remain as black glass islands. Two petaled jaws fold back to reveal a throat like a smelting channel; heat mirage coils from its breath even in subzero air. Its tunnel walls are glazed to greenish glass, seeded with the shadows of things that tried to flee.  
Disposition: Winter ambush artist and thermal trap. The remorhaz stalks by listening—vibrations on ice, the drum of boots—then erupts under the rearmost, swallowing and retreating before lines can reform. It fights the map: collapses bridges with rolling heat, turns cover to slag, and weaponizes panic by forcing the living to cluster on cracking ice. If injured it spirals down its own glass shaft, baiting pursuers into a kiln where air is already an enemy.
