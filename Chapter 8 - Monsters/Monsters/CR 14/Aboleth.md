- **Size:** Large (20–25 ft, 3,000–5,000 lbs)
- **Appearance:** An ancient river of flesh—eel-smooth, slate-blue, eyes like cloudy moons set along the flanks. Its skin weeps translucent slime that catches light like oil on water; patterns drift beneath the surface as if it were dreaming in slow motion. Its lairs are drowned archives: pillars carved into spines, murals that change when waded through, and statues kneeling in silt with mouths full of pearl grit.
- **Disposition:** Archivist of dependence. It never meets strength with strength; it teaches need. First it stains lungs with thought—whispers cast as currents—then it asks the one who listens best to bring the others. It fights at the edge of breathable air, tugging swimmers down by their memories, breaking formation with illusions of long-lost faces. If threatened it leaves its body like an old robe, puppeting slaves through the dark while it chooses a better story elsewhere.
