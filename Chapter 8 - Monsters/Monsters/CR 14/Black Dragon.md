Appearance: Oil-slick scales with jagged horn ridges and a skull-like snout. Acidic drool pits stone; wings glisten as if wet even when the air is dry. Its lairs are drowned halls and tree-sunk ruins where every surface weeps.  
Disposition: Swamp tyrant and ambush artist. It fights from waterlines, surfacing behind the rearmost foe, then sinking back into black water before retaliation. It chooses targets by smell—metal first, then fear—and corrodes cover to deny safety. If cornered, it topples pillars and floods tunnels to separate prey into digestible pieces.
