- **Appearance:** A skull-orb wreathed in cold vapor, with ten blackened stalks ending in sockets of starless night. Old bite-marks scar the enamel; iron staples hold jawbones where decay broke them. A cone of pale darkness pours from the central socket like moonlight run backward, bleaching color and hope.
- **Disposition:** Mortuary general. It treats combat as a procession—slow, ceremonial, inexorable. First it dims the world, then it unravels heroes in a sequence: sap movement, still the heart with fear, erase the defiant with annihilating beams. It never chases; it herds, collapsing bridges and freezing stairways until opponents must pass through the cone of death to reach it.
