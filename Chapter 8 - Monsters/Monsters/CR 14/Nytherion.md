Appearance: The Nytherion is a massive, otherworldly leviathan cloaked in flowing tendrils of aetheric vapor, its sleek body glittering with starlight and rippling fractals. Its surface appears translucent in places, revealing glimpses of celestial void and distant constellations pulsing beneath its skin. Eyes dot its form irregularly, each blinking at different rhythms as if perceiving multiple dimensions at once. When it moves, the air bends unnaturally, as though struggling to remember where the creature actually is.
Disposition: Nytherions are thought to be born from rifts in the fabric of reality, ancient echoes of astral storms or failed gods that never fully died. They are immensely intelligent but alien in purpose, drawn to sites of magical upheaval or cosmic imbalance. Though rarely aggressive without cause, their presence destabilizes the world around them, warping matter and thought alike. In battle, they blink across space with precision, unleashing waves of destructive force that tear not at flesh, but at the very idea of being. Thunderous vibrations are one of the few anchors that can scatter their form and reassert realityâ€™s hold.
