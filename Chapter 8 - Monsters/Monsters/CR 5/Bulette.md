- **HP:** 232 (16d12+128)
- **Vitality:** 120 (14d10+40)
- **Speed:** 40 ft, Burrow 40 ft
- **Size:** Large (5–6 ft at carapace, 12–14 ft long, 1,800–2,400 lbs)
- **Appearance:** A “land-shark” plated in overlapping slate shingles, its wedge-shaped head plows furrows through stone and soil alike. When it surfaces, gravel and broken earth cascade from its armored back in a deafening roar. Its claws are shovel-like blades, and its maw is lined with teeth thick enough to pierce plate. Few things survive the shock of its eruption.
- **Disposition:** A relentless shock predator, the bulette stalks by vibration, erupting beneath back lines before diving back underground. It strikes, vanishes, and strikes again until the battlefield is still—or it is. Its hunger is insatiable, and its lairs are little more than collapsed tunnels filled with gnawed bones and shattered armor.

**Weaknesses:** Thunder

**Abilities**
- **Bite.** Melee Attack: +15 to hit, 4d12+10 piercing damage.
- **Deadly Leap.** If the bulette moves at least 15 ft and jumps, each creature in a 15-ft radius must make a DC 20 STR or DEX save (target’s choice). On a failure, a creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning + 4d6 slashing damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half damage and remains standing.
- **Burrow Ambush (Reaction).** When a creature within 10 ft of the bulette moves, the bulette may use its reaction to burrow and re-emerge, making a Bite attack against that creature.
