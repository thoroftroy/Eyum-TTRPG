- **Appearance:** The Glareon resembles a massive feline predator, its golden-white fur glowing with a low, steady light. Its mane bristles with radiant filaments like solar quills, and every pawstep sears faint impressions into stone. Its amber, pupil-less eyes blaze in the dark, giving it an almost celestial aspect. In direct sunlight, its body pulses with blinding brilliance, making its form difficult to look upon directly.
- **Disposition:** Glareons are solitary hunters of highlands and cliffs, renowned for their patience. They stalk prey at range, blinding and wearing it down before the decisive strike. Mountain tribes revere them as omens of change, believing their presence signals upheaval or renewal. Though fierce when cornered, a Glareon does not kill needlessly, testing its foes before unleashing its radiant fury.
