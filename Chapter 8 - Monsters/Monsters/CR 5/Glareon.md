Appearance: The Glareon resembles a great feline predator, with golden-white fur that emits a constant, low glow. Its mane bristles with light-charged filaments like solar quills, and its paws leave scorched impressions on stone. Its amber eyes lack pupils and shine brightly in dim areas, giving it a divine or celestial look. In sunlight, the Glareon's outline pulses with an almost blinding radiance.
Disposition: Glareons are solitary highland hunters known for their unwavering patience. They stalk prey from a distance, blinding and exhausting it before striking. Despite their predatory nature, they are revered by certain mountain tribes as sacred omens of change. A Glareon will never attack without provocation or hunger and often tests a foe's resolve before fully committing.
