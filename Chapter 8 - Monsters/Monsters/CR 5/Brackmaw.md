- **Appearance:** The Brackmaw resembles a monstrous crocodilian with barnacle-crusted scales, algae-draped flanks, and jagged teeth that jut even when its maw is shut. Its body is thick and low-slung, with tusk-like fangs jutting sideways to snap prey in place. Brine oozes down its back in rivulets, leaving wet streaks wherever it crawls, and its glowing yellow-green eyes pierce fog and shadow alike. Its roar echoes like a collapsing cavern, rattling even seasoned warriors.
- **Disposition:** An ambush predator of brackish deltas, drowned ruins, and fetid marshes, the Brackmaw waits submerged for hours before erupting upward with terrifying speed. If its first strike fails, it often returns to lurking, but when enraged it fights with brutal persistence. Its guttural roar can shatter the will of lesser beasts and terrify even veteran hunters.
