Appearance: The Brackmaw resembles a monstrous crocodilian with knotted barnacle-covered scales, algae-draped flanks, and jagged teeth protruding even with its mouth shut. It has a thick, low-slung body and two sets of tusk-like lower fangs that snap sideways into prey. Its back oozes brine, and its yellow-green eyes glow faintly in fog.
Disposition: Brackmaws are ambush predators that haunt brackish river deltas, ruins, and fetid marshes. They are slow-moving out of water but can lunge with terrifying speed from submerged cover. Brackmaws rarely give chase, if a target escapes its first attack, it often returns to waiting. When enraged or wounded, however, they unleash a guttural roar that stuns lesser animals into submission.
