- **Appearance:** The Cindrak is a fire-scarred arboreal lizard with ember-red scales and long hooked limbs. Its prehensile tail smolders at the tip, and its gullet glows faintly with trapped heat. Its claws shimmer with faint mirages, and when stressed, molten amber leaks from cracks across its back. Its movements are unnervingly silent for such a large predator, and the scent of scorched resin follows in its wake.
- **Disposition:** Cindraks are elusive canopy-dwellers of volcanic jungles, drawn to areas recently scorched by fire. Highly adaptive for beasts, they mimic patterns of movement, mark trees with claw signs, and hide caches in ash-buried hollows. They prefer to ambush from above, striking suddenly before vanishing back into the canopy. Fiercely independent, they avoid conflict unless forced or provoked.
