Appearance: The Cindrak is a fire-scarred arboreal lizard with ember-red scales and long hooked limbs. Its tail is prehensile and smoldering at the tip, and its gullet occasionally glows with trapped heat. Its breath is dry and seething, and its claws emit faint heat mirages when it perches. Molten amber sometimes leaks from cracks in its back when stressed.
Disposition: Cindraks are elusive canopy-dwellers from volcanic jungles, drawn to areas recently touched by flame. Unlike most beasts, they show high learning capacity, mimicking movement patterns, marking trees with claw signs, and hiding ash-buried caches. They strike from above, leaping branch to branch with deceptive silence. Despite their deadly nature, they avoid unnecessary conflict and prefer isolation.
