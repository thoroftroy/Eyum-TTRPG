- **Appearance:** A low, tank-bodied herbivore armored in thick, jagged bony plates, with a mace-tail the size of a barrel. Its calm, heavy eyes belie its destructive potential—when threatened, its tail rises like a drawbridge before coming down with earthshaking force. Its back gleams with ridged, calcified armor strong enough to deflect blades and arrows, and its footsteps crack the earth like thunder.
- **Disposition:** A defensive behemoth, it holds its ground against any perceived threat. It smashes anything that approaches its young or herd, then plods away once danger has fled. Though not aggressive by nature, its wrath is catastrophic when provoked, often leaving the land scarred in its wake.
