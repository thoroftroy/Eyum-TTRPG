- **Appearance:** The Nyxslink is a lithe, four-limbed predator covered in mottled gray-black fur that shimmers like wet stone in dim light. Its elongated limbs end in hooked, clawed digits perfect for clinging to vertical stone, and its oversized, milky eyes pierce the deepest dark without blinking. Faint bioluminescent streaks run along its spine and jaw, pulsing with each breath. When its mouth opens, it reveals rows of needle-fangs dripping with thick, green venom.
- **Disposition:** Apex ambush predators of deep caverns and shadow-choked canyons, Nyxslinks stalk prey for hours, striking only when the kill is assured. They seem to delight in the hunt, circling their targets and striking from darkness before melting back into shadow. They are drawn to magic, and divine light enrages them, provoking frenzied attacks. Even seasoned explorers whisper of Nyxslinks, warning to never rest near fading torchlight.
