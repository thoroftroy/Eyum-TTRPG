Appearance: The Nyxslink is a lithe, four-limbed predator covered in mottled gray-black fur that shimmers like wet stone in low light. Its elongated limbs end in clawed digits ideal for clinging to rock, and its eyes are oversized, milky, and unblinking, perfect for piercing total darkness. Faint bioluminescent streaks run along its spine and jawline, pulsing softly with each breath. When it opens its mouth, it reveals needle-thin fangs glistening with a thick, greenish venom.
Disposition: Nyxslinks are apex ambush predators native to deep caverns, forgotten tombs, and shadow-choked canyons. They hunt by stalking silently from above, using dim light to vanish between shadows before pouncing with lethal precision. Unlike most beasts, they seem to enjoy the hunt, circling prey, testing defenses, and striking only when advantage is certain. They are drawn to magic, especially sources of divine light, which seems to pain or enrage them. Even experienced spelunkers speak of Nyxslinks in hushed tones, warning never to linger near the edges of torchlight.
