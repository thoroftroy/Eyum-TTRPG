Appearance: The Umbragorge is a nightmarish mass of sinew and void, vaguely humanoid but warped beyond recognition. Its body is slick and dark as tar, with countless fang-lined mouths opening and closing across its limbs, chest, and even its back. A central maw dominates its face, wide enough to engulf a man whole, and ringed with twitching tendrils that pulse with psychic energy. Its limbs end in jagged claws, and its eyes, if they can be called such, glow faintly with a violet hunger that seems to pierce both armor and sanity.
Disposition: An Umbragorge is a predator born of nightmares and hollow spaces, hungering not only for flesh, but for thought and memory. It moves with unnerving silence and disturbing grace, climbing walls or phasing through shadow to stalk prey in labyrinthine tunnels, ancient dungeons, or realms touched by the Void. Intelligent and cunning, it prefers ambushes, weakening minds with psychic assaults before tearing into weakened foes to feed and regenerate. Though it can speak, it rarely does, its voice is a layered chorus of whispering mouths, each one echoing with the madness it has devoured.
