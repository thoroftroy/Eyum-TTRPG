- **Appearance:** The Umbragorge is a nightmarish tangle of sinew and void, vaguely humanoid but warped beyond recognition. Its tar-black body writhes with countless fang-lined mouths opening and closing across its limbs, chest, and back. A massive central maw dominates its face, ringed with tendrils that twitch with psychic energy. Its jagged claws drip ichor, and faint violet lights—hunger given form—peer from the dark hollows it calls eyes. Its very presence makes the air feel thinner, as though it devours sanity before flesh.
- **Disposition:** Born of nightmares and hollow spaces, the Umbragorge hungers for flesh, thought, and memory alike. It stalks prey with uncanny silence, slipping through shadows and climbing walls as though weightless. Cunning and intelligent, it prefers to weaken foes with psychic torment before lunging to feed, regenerating from every bite. When it speaks, its voice is a chorus of whispering mouths, dripping madness with every syllable.
