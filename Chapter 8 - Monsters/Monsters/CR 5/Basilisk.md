- **Vitality:** 96 (12d8+36)
- **Speed:** 30 ft
- **Size:** Medium (4 ft tall, 8 ft long, 300–400 lbs)
- **Appearance:** A heavy, eight-eyed lizard with iron-hard scales dusted in gray powder from the statues of its victims. Each eye glimmers with a dull, stone-colored sheen, and its sluggish breath exhales flecks of powdered rock. Its claws scrape like chisels across stone, and its stare alone carries the weight of a tomb.
- **Disposition:** Territorial ambusher that lairs in caverns, ruins, or petrified graveyards of its own making. It waits motionless, blending into stone, until prey draws close. Its jaws are cruel, but its true weapon is its gaze—creatures that lock eyes with it rarely escape whole.

- INT: 2 (−4)

**Abilities**
- **Bite.** Melee Attack: +13 to hit, 3d10+7 piercing damage.
- **Petrifying Gaze.** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 ft of the basilisk and can see its eyes must succeed on a DC 19 CON save or begin turning to stone. On a failure, the creature is _Restrained_. If it fails again at the start of its next turn, it becomes _Petrified_. On a success, the effect ends.
- **Stoneborn Hide.** The basilisk has advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone or moved against its will, as its body is unnaturally heavy.
