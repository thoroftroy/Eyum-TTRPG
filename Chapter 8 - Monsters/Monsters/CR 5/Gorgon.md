- **Appearance:** An iron-plated bull snorting metallic vapor, its hooves sparking arcs of lightning across stone as it charges.

- **Disposition:** Shock-charger that annihilates formations. It tramples lines, petrifies clusters of foes with its breath, and smashes stone statues into rubble to spread fear. It does not retreat once engaged—its fury only ends in ruin.
