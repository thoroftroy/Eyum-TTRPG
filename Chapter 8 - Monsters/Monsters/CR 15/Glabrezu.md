- **Appearance:** A banquet of bad choices—towering, four-armed, two delicate hands for signing contracts and two crushing pincers for keeping them. Its hide is midnight velvet that drinks torchlight; its tusks are scrimshawed with names that start whispering when read.
- **Disposition:** Temptation tactician. It offers victory now at a price later, and while heroes debate, it makes the debate worse—dragging one ally into reach with a handshake while the pincers select a limb to remember. It loves choke points and audiences, especially both. When resisted it sheds civility and becomes a thunderhead of muscle and fury until something breaks (preferably a promise).
