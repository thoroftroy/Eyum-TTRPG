Height: 12–14 ft  
Weight: 1,200–1,800 lbs  
Appearance: A banquet of bad choices—towering, four-armed, two delicate hands for signing contracts and two crushing pincers for keeping them. Its hide is midnight velvet that drinks torchlight; its tusks are scrimshawed with names that start whispering when read.  
Disposition: Temptation tactician. It offers victory now at a price later, and while heroes debate, it makes the debate worse—dragging one ally into reach with a handshake while the pincers select a limb to remember. It loves choke points and audiences, especially both. When resisted it sheds civility and becomes a thunderhead of muscle and fury until something breaks (preferably a promise).

Witching Hand (Recharge 5–6): Ranged 60 ft; DC 19 CHA save or the target is charmed and must use its action to move toward the glabrezu on its next turn.  
Promise Broken: If a Charmed creature attacks the glabrezu, it takes 4d10 psychic from backlash.
