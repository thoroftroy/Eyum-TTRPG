- **Size:** Huge (13–15 ft at shoulder; 40–50 ft long; 18,000–28,000 lbs)
- **Appearance:** Verdant plates with darker, thorned ridges; moss grows between scales like a forest on armor. Teeth are long and inward-curved, stained green-black; breath reeks of rot and sweet sap. Wherever it lairs, ivy strangles walls and the canopy thickens to lightless green.
- **Disposition:** Manipulator and stage director. The green dragon never fights fair: it forces parley to learn names, cozens NPCs into “accidental” flanks, and chooses terrain that turns every step into a choke. In battle it opens with poison breath through foliage that hides its body, then stalks the slowest target while taunting the bold. If hurt, it withdraws into thorns and returns from an unexpected angle after the party’s formation frays.
