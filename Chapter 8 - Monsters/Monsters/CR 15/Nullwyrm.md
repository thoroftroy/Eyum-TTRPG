Appearance: The Nullwyrm is a long, sinuous dragon cloaked in shadow that twists unnaturally around its body, as if reality itself recoils from its presence. Its scales are a deep void-black that shimmer with faint violet undertones, and its wings are torn veils of darkness that ripple like oil in the wind. Its horns curl backward like jagged crescents, and its eyes glow with a sickly light, part hunger, part memory of something long dead. Wherever it flies, nightmares bleed into the waking world, and sleep turns sour in its wake.
Disposition: Nullwyrms dwell between the veil of dreams and death, stalking the material world through rifts torn by sorrow, war, or forbidden magic. Highly intelligent and spiteful, they do not conquer like other dragons, they unravel. They feast on fear, erode sanity, and turn would-be heroes into husks of regret. In flight, they are nearly untouchable, sheathed in shadow and invulnerable to mundane assaults. Facing a Nullwyrm means facing your worst thoughts made flesh, and even surviving the battle does not guarantee youâ€™ll ever sleep soundly again.
