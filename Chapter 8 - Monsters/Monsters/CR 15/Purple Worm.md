Appearance: A cathedral of muscle armored in mauve plates, mouth a revolving cathedral door of teeth. Segments flex with hydraulic grace, spraying quartz dust; its tunnel walls are ribbed, polished, and warm as living throats. Drifts of shed chitin glitter like purple glass dunes. When it surfaces, wind pulls toward it, as if the world were inhaling.  
Disposition: Catastrophe more than combatant. It answers sound with geometry: swallow the drummer, collapse the mezzanine, make the room fit the worm. It prefers to divide parties into “inside” and “outside,” and then let those categories argue about rescue while it digs away with a prize. Fire irritates, lightning enrages; pain slows it only long enough to change direction toward louder food.

Rending Bite: Melee +13 to hit, 8d10+9 piercing; if this drops a creature to 0 Vitality, it is also Grappled (escape DC 20).  
Swallow: A Grappled Medium or smaller creature must succeed on DC 20 DEX or be swallowed (start of its turns: 4d10 acid; the worm takes 20 damage if a swallowed creature deals 20+ in a turn).  
Tremor Dive (Recharge 5–6): Burrow up to 30 ft and re-emerge, creatures within 10 ft make DC 18 DEX or fall prone and take 4d10 bludgeoning.
