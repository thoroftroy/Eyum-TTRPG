- **Size:** Gargantuan (70–90 ft, 40–80 tons)
- **Appearance:** A cathedral of muscle armored in mauve plates, mouth a revolving cathedral door of teeth. Segments flex with hydraulic grace, spraying quartz dust; its tunnel walls are ribbed, polished, and warm as living throats. Drifts of shed chitin glitter like purple glass dunes. When it surfaces, wind pulls toward it, as if the world were inhaling.
- **Disposition:** Catastrophe more than combatant. It answers sound with geometry: swallow the drummer, collapse the mezzanine, make the room fit the worm. It prefers to divide parties into “inside” and “outside,” and then let those categories argue about rescue while it digs away with a prize. Fire irritates, lightning enrages; pain slows it only long enough to change direction toward louder food.

**Abilities**
- **Rending Bite.** Melee Attack: +42 to hit, 15d12+45 piercing. If this reduces a creature to 0 Vitality, it is automatically Grappled (escape DC 96).
- **Swallow.** A Grappled creature of Huge size or smaller must succeed on a DC 96 Dexterity save or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is Restrained, blinded, and takes 10d12 acid damage at the start of each of the worm’s turns. If a swallowed creature deals 200+ damage in a single turn, the worm must succeed on a DC 96 Constitution save or regurgitate all swallowed creatures.
- **Tremor Dive (Recharge 5–6).** The worm burrows up to 60 ft and erupts violently. All creatures within 60 ft of emergence must succeed on a DC 96 Dexterity save or fall prone and take 8d12 bludgeoning (success: half damage, no prone).
- **Living Catastrophe (Passive).** Structures and terrain within 120 ft of the purple worm’s movement automatically collapse unless reinforced magically. All creatures standing on such terrain must succeed on a DC 96 Dexterity save or fall prone.
