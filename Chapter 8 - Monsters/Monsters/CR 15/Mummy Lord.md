- **AC:** 92
- **HP:** 7,600 (120d12+3,600)
- **Vitality:** 3,000 (120d10+1,500)
- **Speed:** 30 ft
- **Size:** Medium (5–6 ft, 90–130 lbs)
- **Appearance:** Regal wrappings lacquered with resins hold the body in an impeccable, ceremonial posture. Gold cartouches and cracked faience beads stitch their history across the chest in glyph lines; dried oils perfume the air with myrrh and dust. The mouth is stuffed with coins and jade shards that rattle when it speaks, and its eyes burn like twin nails of dusk hammered into a skull mask. Its tomb-gear—crook, flail, and a sun-disc diadem—has been blackened by curses into icons of dominion over rot.
- **Disposition:** A battlefield monarch who expects obedience even from enemies. It opens with a curse pronounced like a sentence, then lets guardians and traps absorb the first assault while it measures the disobedient. It spends power conservatively—sealing exits, isolating a healer with sand-surge, and striking last with a paralyzing decree that forces a choice between retreat and blasphemy. If threatened, it withdraws behind sarcophagi and commands the room itself—sand turns to hands, pillars exhale choking dust—until supplicants kneel or suffocate.

**Abilities**
- **Rotting Fist.** Melee Attack: +40 to hit, 12d12+37 Bludgeoning + 8d10 Necrotic. On a hit, the target suffers a wasting curse: Disadvantage on STR-based checks and saves until removed by Greater Restoration or equivalent.
- **Royal Malediction (Recharge 5–6).** The Mummy Lord exhales a 60-ft cone of cursed sand. All creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 90 Wisdom save or take 15d12 Necrotic damage and cannot regain HP until the end of their next turn. On success, they take half damage and avoid the healing restriction.
- **Tomb Sovereign (Passive).** While in its lair, the Mummy Lord controls the battlefield: doors seal, sand becomes grasping hands, and pillars exhale choking dust. All enemy movement in the lair is considered Difficult Terrain, and hostile creatures begin their turns making a DC 90 CON save or take 5d12 Necrotic damage from suffocating sands.
- **Spellcasting (Ritual & Divine).** The Mummy Lord wields devastating tomb-magic, favoring curses, battlefield control, and radiant ward-breaking spells. It may cast up to 10 spells per turn, each with DC 90 saving throws where applicable.
