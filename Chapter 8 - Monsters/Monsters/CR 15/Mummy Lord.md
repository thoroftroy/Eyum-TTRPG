Appearance: Regal wrappings lacquered with resins hold the body in an impeccable, ceremonial posture. Gold cartouches and cracked faience beads stitch their history across the chest in glyph lines; dried oils perfume the air with myrrh and dust. The mouth is stuffed with coins and jade shards that rattle when it speaks, and its eyes burn like twin nails of dusk hammered into a skull mask. Its tomb-gear—crook, flail, and a sun-disc diadem—has been blackened by curses into icons of dominion over rot.  
Disposition: A battlefield monarch who expects obedience even from enemies. It opens with a curse pronounced like a sentence, then lets guardians and traps absorb the first assault while it measures the disobedient. It spends power conservatively—sealing exits, isolating a healer with sand-surge, and striking last with a paralyzing decree that forces a choice between retreat and blasphemy. If threatened, it withdraws behind sarcophagi and commands the room itself—sand turns to hands, pillars exhale choking dust—until supplicants kneel or suffocate.
