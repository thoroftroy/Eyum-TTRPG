- **Appearance:** A courtier stitched from contradictions: tiger’s eyes behind a prince’s smile; hands whose palms wear the claws. Silks carry patterns that repeat at impossible intervals; jewels show reflections from other rooms. Incense follows it like applause. Writing near it tends to rearrange so the most flattering lines rise to the top.
- **Disposition:** Duelist of promises. It feasts on certainty, first by predicting it, then by selling it back on worse terms. It opens with flattery that sounds like command, uses illusions to braid allies into each other’s lines of fire, and strikes only where betrayal will echo. When cornered, it steps through etiquette—literally—and out of the scene via a door that didn’t exist until it bowed to it.

**Weaknesses:** Radiant

**Abilities**
- **Reverse-Grip Claws.** Melee Attack: +48 to hit, 12d12+37 Slashing damage.
- **Compelling Mirage (Recharge 5–6).** The rakshasa weaves a fractal illusion over a 60-ft cube. All creatures inside must make a DC 95 Wisdom save or be compelled to move up to 30 ft toward a point of the rakshasa’s choice before taking their action. On success, they perceive the illusion but are not compelled.
- **Counter-Chant (Reaction).** When targeted by a spell, the rakshasa imposes Disadvantage on the caster’s attack roll or forces them to succeed on a DC 95 Casting Ability Check (depending on spell type). On a fail, the spell fizzles and the slot is expended.
- **Court of Lies (Passive).** All hostile creatures within 30 ft suffer Disadvantage on Insight and Perception checks, and must succeed on a DC 95 Charisma save at the start of their turn or be Charmed until the end of that turn.
