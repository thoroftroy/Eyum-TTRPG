Appearance: A courtier stitched from contradictions: tiger’s eyes behind a prince’s smile; hands whose palms wear the claws. Silks carry patterns that repeat at impossible intervals; jewels show reflections from other rooms. Incense follows it like applause. Writing near it tends to rearrange so the most flattering lines rise to the top.  
Disposition: Duelist of promises. It feasts on certainty, first by predicting it, then by selling it back on worse terms. It opens with flattery that sounds like command, uses illusions to braid allies into each other’s lines of fire, and strikes only where betrayal will echo. When cornered, it steps through etiquette—literally—and out of the scene via a door that didn’t exist until it bowed to it.
