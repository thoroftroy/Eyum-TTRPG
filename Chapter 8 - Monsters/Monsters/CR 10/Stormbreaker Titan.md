Appearance: The Stormbreaker Titan is a towering colossus of charged crystal, burnished steel, and storm-forged stone. Its body is etched with glowing runes that pulse with trapped lightning, and its arms are massive pylons shaped like ancient hammers, constantly arcing with electricity. A thundercloud hovers above it wherever it roams, with bolts occasionally striking its shoulders and recharging its volatile core. Its faceplate is featureless save for twin arcs of white-blue energy that crackle where eyes should be.
Disposition: Built as walking engines of judgment by forgotten stormcallers, Stormbreaker Titans are guardians of elemental balance, bound to sky temples, shattered mesas, or relic fortresses left adrift in the clouds. Though rarely aggressive unprovoked, they respond to intrusion with apocalyptic force, channeling lightning into devastating shockwaves that reduce even armored legions to ash. They grow stronger when struck by storm energy, absorbing it into their frame and redirecting it with terrifying precision. Few constructs retain such fury after centuries of stillness; when one awakens, the horizon answers with thunder.
