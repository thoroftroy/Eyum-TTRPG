- **Appearance:** The Stormbreaker Titan looms as a colossus of burnished steel, charged crystal, and storm-forged stone, its body seared with glowing runes that pulse like veins of lightning. Its arms are colossal pylons shaped like ancient war-hammers, every swing tearing the air with thunderous arcs. A thundercloud perpetually follows it, lightning striking its frame to recharge the volatile storm-core that burns in its chest. Its faceplate is featureless, save for twin arcs of white-blue energy where eyes should be, casting a glare brighter than any torch. When it moves, the ground trembles and the sky itself answers with rolling thunder.
- **Disposition:** Created by stormcallers as judgment-walkers, Stormbreaker Titans are elemental guardians bound to ruined temples and sky-fortresses. They awaken only when provoked, unleashing devastation on scales fit to annihilate legions. In battle they channel lightning into storms that ripple across battlefields, scattering armies and sundering fortifications. Each strike fuels them further, as storm energy absorbed into their core restores their already terrifying endurance. A single Titan’s awakening is said to blacken horizons, its wrath turning night into lightning-ripped day.
