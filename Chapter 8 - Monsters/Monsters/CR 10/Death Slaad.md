- **Appearance:** The Death Slaad towers as an obsidian-skinned juggernaut, its hide studded with jagged bone spurs jutting from its spine and elbows like the antlers of some infernal beast. Its jaw unhinges far too wide, revealing a second row of inward-curving teeth meant to trap screams and silence pleas. The air around it vibrates with a metallic hum, like a struck wire, and its presence alone makes skin crawl and blood feel unsteady in the veins.
- **Disposition:** The Death Slaad is violence distilled into strategy. It prunes battlefields with cruel calculation—eliminating healers first, cutting down mages second, and leaving the rest to collapse in despair. It strikes with sudden, joyful savagery, then goes perfectly still, listening, waiting, before rushing to silence the loudest dying cry. If it cannot make a clean kill, it seeds its wounds with entropy, ensuring its victims wither in ruin no matter how far they flee.
