Appearance: A towering, obsidian-skinned tyrant with bone spurs growing like antlers from elbows and spine. Its mouth opens too wide, revealing a second set of inward-curving teeth meant for keeping things that beg inside. The air hums around it like a struck wire.  
Disposition: Catastrophe in a smile. The death slaad treats battle as pruning: remove the healer, trim the mage, let the rest wither. It moves with sudden, joyful violence, then goes still, listening for who dies loudest, and goes there next. If denied a clean kill, it seeds wounds with ruin and enjoys the slow harvest.
