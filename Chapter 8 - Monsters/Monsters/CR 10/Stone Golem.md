- **Appearance:** The Stone Golem is carved from a single colossal block of granite, its body marked by runes etched deep into its joints and filled with veins of golden leaf. Dust blooms with each ponderous step, and when its head turns, the sound of grinding quarry stones echoes ominously. A faint, pulsing glow radiates from the rune engraved in its chest, throbbing like a heartbeat too slow to be mortal.
- **Disposition:** A relentless sentinel, the Stone Golem is utterly devoted to its warded purpose. Pain, provocation, or distraction mean nothing to it—only the command etched into its being. In combat it becomes a living wall, holding chokepoints, soaking blows that would kill dozens, and swatting down the swiftest foes to trap prey within its reach. Even when pushed back, it only resets its stance, unyielding as the earth itself.
