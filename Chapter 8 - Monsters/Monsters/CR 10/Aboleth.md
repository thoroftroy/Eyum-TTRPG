Appearance: A mucous-slick leviathan with three lamp-eyes stacked vertically and a mouth like a lamprey grinder. Its skin gleams oil-green, leaving rainbow sheens on water; the stink of brine and ancient rot clings to it like a memory.  
Disposition: It fights like a conspiracy. Before blades are ever drawn, it has already seeded dreams and bribes, lured victims to water, and arranged witnesses to vanish. In battle it weaponizes terrain—flooding chambers, shattering bridges, and sending thralls to die as walls of meat while it lashes from below. If bloodied, it retreats through a submerged vent to regroup with fresh puppets.
