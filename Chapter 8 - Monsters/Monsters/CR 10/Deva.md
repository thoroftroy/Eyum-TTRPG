Appearance: A serene warrior in soft lamellar of silver-white light, wings folded like doves in a chapel. Their voice is a bell in fog, and their skin carries the faint glow of candlelight seen through alabaster. Wherever they stand, dust settles, and the smell of rain seems newly remembered.  
Disposition: Emissary first, avenger second. A deva enters with an offer of surrender or parley, then fights with calm precision if refused—interposing for the weak, disabling rather than killing where possible, and reserving wrath for oath-breakers. In chaos it becomes a shepherd, cutting lanes for allies to escape or pursue justice, and will gladly take a blow meant for another if that saves a soul for another day.
