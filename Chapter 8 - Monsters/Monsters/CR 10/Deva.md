- **Appearance:** The Deva appears as a serene warrior, clad in lamellar that shines like silver-white light shaped into armor. Their alabaster skin glows faintly like candlelight glimpsed through marble, and their voice tolls with the clarity of a bell ringing through fog. Dove-like wings fold across their back, carrying with them the quiet dignity of a chapel at dawn. Wherever they tread, dust settles in reverence, and the air fills with the remembered scent of rain on stone.
- **Disposition:** Devas arrive as emissaries first, avengers second. They extend surrender or parley before lifting their blade, preferring to interpose themselves for the weak and disable foes rather than slay them outright. Yet when oaths are broken or cruelty is unveiled, their precision turns lethal, striking as divine judgment. In chaos, they act as shepherds—cutting paths for allies, absorbing blows for the defenseless, and ensuring the survival of justice itself.
