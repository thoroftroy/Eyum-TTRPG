Appearance: The Zephyrix is a sleek, serpentine dragon with elongated wings that stretch nearly twice the length of its body, their edges crackling with arcs of static energy. Its scales shimmer in shades of silver and storm-gray, with streaks of electric blue running down its back and tail like living lightning veins. Feathered frills crown its head and spine, constantly fluttering in response to shifts in the air, and its eyes glow faintly with a focused, storm-born intelligence. When it flies, it leaves a rippling distortion in its wake, felt more than seen.
Disposition: Zephyrixes are aerial predators and proud guardians of the open sky, dwelling in mountaintop shrines, floating isles, or thunder-scarred stormbelts. They are agile, cunning, and territorial, engaging in complex airborne duels with rivals or intruders, rarely landing unless wounded. While not needlessly cruel, they view those who cannot fly as inferior and will often test ground-dwellers with bursts of wind and lightning before deciding whether they are worth their time. Their presence stirs the winds, calls the clouds, and often heralds the birth of a great storm.
