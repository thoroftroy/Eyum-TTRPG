Appearance: A monarch welded to a walking siege throne, draped in banners woven from sins confessed too late. Ember-veins ladder the armor; each pulse corresponds to a soul screaming through the chimneys in its back. A blade like a collapsed anvil rides across its lap, chained to the throne by prayer-links made of rusted crowns. The ground remembers its passages as clinker glass and heel-shaped craters.  
Disposition: Dictatorship made kinetic. The Imperator doesn’t chase; it **annexes**—plants its throne in the center, declares every step a tax, and fines anyone who tries to maneuver with furnace gales. It turns downed bodies into entrenchments, and when hope rallies it signs a treaty with one heartbeat in the room and breaks it a moment later with the rest watching.

Coronation Greatsword: Melee Attack +17 to hit, **11d12+10** slashing; on hit, creatures within 10 ft of the target take **3d8** fire as cinders jet from the wound. (Damage in CR 16–20 band.)
Edict of Ash (Recharge 5–6): 30-ft radius aura centered on the Imperator; foes of choice make a DC **23** WIS save or are **Frightened** for 2 rounds and take **6d10** fire (half and no fear on success).  
Cinder Bulwark: As a bonus action, raise a 15-ft semicircle of slag (AC 18, 60 HP). The wall grants half cover to creatures behind it.
