- **Appearance:** A monarch welded to a walking siege throne, draped in banners woven from sins confessed too late. Ember-veins ladder the armor; each pulse corresponds to a soul screaming through the chimneys in its back. A blade like a collapsed anvil rides across its lap, chained to the throne by prayer-links made of rusted crowns. The ground remembers its passages as clinker glass and heel-shaped craters.
- **Disposition:** Dictatorship made kinetic. The Imperator doesn’t chase; it **annexes**—plants its throne in the center, declares every step a tax, and fines anyone who tries to maneuver with furnace gales. It turns downed bodies into entrenchments, and when hope rallies it signs a treaty with one heartbeat in the room and breaks it a moment later with the rest watching.

**Abilities**
- **Coronation Greatsword.** Melee Attack: +42 to hit, 22d12+60 slashing. On hit, creatures within 10 ft of the target take 6d8 fire as cinders jet from the wound.
- **Edict of Ash (Recharge 5–6).** 30-ft radius aura centered on the Imperator; creatures of choice make a DC 85 WIS save or are **Frightened** for 2 rounds and take 12d10 fire (half and no fear on success).
- **Cinder Bulwark.** As a bonus action, raise a 15-ft semicircle of slag (AC 180, 600 HP). The wall grants half cover to creatures behind it.
- **Iron Annexation (Passive).** Whenever the Imperator reduces a creature to 0 HP, the ground around the body becomes entrenchment: 10 ft radius of difficult terrain centered on the corpse, lasting until cleared.
