Appearance: A walking primeval banyan whose roots wear the earth like a cloak. Sap runs in amber rivers beneath cracked bark; flowers open along its shoulders on a schedule tied to storms half a world away. Fungal gardens drift in its wake like weather; moths the size of shields roost in hollows that glow with foxfire. When it roars, leaves bow in miles-wide waves as if taking a knee.  
Disposition: Ecosystem general. It fights to restore “forest law”: walls become trellises, roads become rivers of loam, and the battlefield regresses into a living maze of buttress roots. It values patience over blood—separating, pinning, composting. Heroes who refuse to learn its paths are treated as deadwood: cut, stacked, burned if necessary. If scorched, the Behemoth sinks into soil, spreads its heart through a thousand rootlets, and rises behind you, taller.
