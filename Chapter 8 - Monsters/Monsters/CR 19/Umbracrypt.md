- **Appearance:** The Umbracrypt is a towering, ethereal figure cloaked in ever-shifting shadow, its form constantly unraveling and reforming like smoke caught in a voidborn wind. It possesses no solid shape, only a vaguely humanoid silhouette with arms that stretch unnaturally, crowned by a veil of shifting tendrils and two piercing violet eyes that burn through the dark. It floats silently, casting no light and bearing no weight, yet the air grows heavy and thick with dread wherever it passes. Even its presence dims magic and memory, as if the world itself recoils from knowing it.
- **Disposition:** Umbracrypts are sovereigns of unreality, masters of thought-warping despair and spatial collapse. They emerge only in moments of total shadow, when a plane is weak, a seal breaks, or a mind falls too far into madness. Their tactics are precise, devastating, and patient; they manipulate space and perception before ever drawing blood. Their power lies not only in brute force but in unraveling the assumptions of reality—what is seen, what is known, what can be trusted. Only radiant power can truly pierce their darkness, and even then, only for a moment.
