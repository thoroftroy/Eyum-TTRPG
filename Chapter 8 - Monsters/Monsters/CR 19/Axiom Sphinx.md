Appearance: A leonine scholar wrought from alabaster and eclipse, mane braided with golden abaci whose beads click in answers you don’t yet know to ask. Its eyes are polished onyx lenses that show not your reflection but your intent. Feathers at the wingtips carry ink that never dries; wherever it perches, stone acquires marginalia. Questions asked in its presence leave frost on the tongue.  
Disposition: Court of causality. The Sphinx never attacks first; it **demands** a proposition. When the claim is weak, it edits the claimant—slowing steps with paradox, binding hands with the consequences of their own boast. It arranges fights as proofs: isolate the lemma (your healer), dismantle the axiom (your formation), then present the theorem (your defeat) with terrifying, patient grace. If overmatched, it changes the problem by factoring the room into mirrored corridors where you are always walking toward your own mistake.
