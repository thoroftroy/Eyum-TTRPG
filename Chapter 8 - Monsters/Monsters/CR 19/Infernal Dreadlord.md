- **Appearance:** The Infernal Dreadlord towers over most creatures, its 25-foot frame sheathed in scorched black armor etched with crimson runes that pulse like molten veins. Massive, jagged horns curl from its helm, and its wings, tattered and smoke-wreathed, beat the air with bursts of brimstone. Its weapon is a colossal flame-forged cleaver, glowing with internal fire and trailing embers with every swing. Its presence is accompanied by a chorus of whispers and screams, as if the souls of the damned follow in its wake.
- **Disposition:** The Infernal Dreadlord is not merely a commander of hellish forces, it is a walking apocalypse, born to lead infernal conquests across planes. It rules through terror and overwhelming force, driving lesser fiends before it and crushing resistance with volcanic wrath. Every strike it delivers shatters the will of armies, and its voice alone can send seasoned heroes fleeing in despair. On the battlefield, it transforms the very ground into a burning wasteland, its flames devouring all but the most resilient foes. Only radiant power holds any hope of piercing the abyssal storm that surrounds it.
