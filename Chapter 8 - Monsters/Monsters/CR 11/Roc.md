- **Appearance:** The Roc is an avalanche of feathers and wind given flesh, its wingspan blotting out the horizon like a rolling storm. Feathers shimmer storm-gray streaked with sunlight-white, and its eyes shine the color of fresh glacier melt. When it descends, its wingbeats tear tents from the ground and strip forests bare, leaving spirals of wreckage in its wake.
- **Disposition:** Rocs are sovereigns of the sky, feared by mortals and monsters alike. They do not hunt for hunger alone, but for dominion—snatching livestock, heroes, or even entire caravans to scatter across the peaks. They open from impossible height, diving in silence, talons extended like the jaws of a mountain. If challenged, they beat hurricanes with their wings to throw enemies down, before carrying their chosen prey into the clouds to fall screaming from the sky.

- **Carry Off.** While grappling, the Roc’s fly speed is halved. If it ends its turn 200+ ft above the ground with a grappled target, that target must succeed on a DC 44 STR save or be dropped.
- **Hurricane Wings (Recharge 5–6).** The Roc beats its wings in a storm surge. All creatures within 100 ft must succeed on a DC 45 STR save or take 10d12 bludgeoning damage and be flung 60 ft away, landing prone. On a success, creatures take half damage and are not flung.
