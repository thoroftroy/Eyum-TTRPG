Weight: 16,000–24,000 lbs  
Appearance: A mountain’s shadow with feathers—storm-gray primaries, sun-bleached secondaries, and eyes the color of glacier melt. When it lands, wind collapses tents and strips leaves from trees in spirals.  
Disposition: Sky sovereign and kidnapper of livestock and heroes alike. It starts high—so high you mistake it for a cloud seam—then stoops in utter silence to snatch a single target and climb, daring the party to give chase into thin air. If grounded, it beats hurricanes with its wings to create space, then launches again carrying whoever didn’t duck fast enough.  
STR: 28 (+9) | DEX: 10 (+0) | CON: 20 (+5) | INT: 3 (−4) | WIS: 12 (+1) | CHA: 10 (+0)  
Resistances: Cold  
Weaknesses: Lightning  
Abilities:  
Talon: Melee Attack +13 to hit, 4d8+9 slashing; on a hit, the target is Grappled (escape DC 20).  
Beak: Melee Attack +13 to hit, 3d10+9 piercing.  
Carry Off: While grappling, the roc’s fly speed is halved; if it ends its turn 100+ ft above ground with a grappled target, that target must succeed on a DC 16 STR save or be dropped.
