- **Appearance:** The Horned Devil is a towering enforcer, its bronze scales gleaming like tempered war-metal beneath cathedral-blackened wings. Its spear-length horns curve forward with cruel precision, and its barbed tail never ceases to flick, shedding sparks that hang in the air like dying stars. Each beat of its ribbed wings scatters cinders across the battlefield, announcing its presence as a herald of infernal order. Its face is grim and calculating, lips never moving except to pronounce judgment already written.
- **Disposition:** Horned Devils are hell’s iron fist, sent to enforce the terms of infernal contracts or to punish breaches with ruthless precision. They fight with relentless patience, dive-spearing isolated targets and herding survivors into positions decreed by pact and prophecy. They are not berserkers—they are executioners, cold and efficient, unwilling to relent until every clause is satisfied. When terms are fulfilled, they withdraw without hesitation, leaving ash, bodies, and smoldering silence in their wake.

- **Infernal Cinders (Recharge 5–6).** The Horned Devil beats its wings, scattering burning embers in a 30-ft cone. All creatures must succeed on a DC 44 DEX save or take 12d12 fire and be Blinded until the end of their next turn (half damage/no blindness on success).
- **Hell’s Enforcement (Aura).** While within 30 ft of the Horned Devil, enemies cannot benefit from teleportation, ethereal travel, or planar escape. Any attempt to do so fails and inflicts 6d8 psychic damage on the caster.
