- **Appearance:** The Behir is a twelve-legged lightning serpent, its cobalt scales gleaming like storm glass. A ridge of jagged horns crowns its brow, funneling crackling arcs of electricity that leap between its fangs when it inhales. Its immense, coiling frame can wrap around cliffsides like a living fortress, or whip along ceilings like a chain of thunder waiting to drop. Where it moves, the air tastes of ozone and hair rises from static, heralding the storm it carries in its lungs.
- **Disposition:** A relentless cliffside ambusher and hunter, the Behir strikes from above or behind with terrifying speed. It prefers to swallow prey whole, ending fights in a single movement, but when cornered, it draws battle lines across narrow passes and floods them with arcs of lightning to scatter foes. It pursues survivors with pitiless determination, each attack designed to break formation and leave its prey isolated. The smarter it fights, the more it seems like an inevitable storm—unavoidable and unrelenting.
