Appearance: A twelve-legged lightning serpent, cobalt scales glossed like storm glass. Horn-ridges funnel into a crown over its brow, and ozone crackles between teeth when it inhales.  
Disposition: Cliffside ambusher and relentless pursuer. It coils around pillars to anchor itself, then whips itself along ceilings to drop behind the formation. It prefers to swallow problems whole; if prey resists, it draws a line of battle across a narrow defile and rips through it with a lightning blast that forces the party to spread thin.
