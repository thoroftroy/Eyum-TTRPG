- **Appearance:** The Ironscourge is a colossal war-machine of forgotten empires, its body clad in seamless black steel reinforced with ancient runic pistons that hiss like volcanic vents. Dented plates bear scars of sieges long past, yet no rust dares touch its surface. Glowing arcane circuits crawl across its bulk like veins of molten iron, pulsing with each earth-shaking stride. Its piledriver fists are built to break fortresses as easily as bone, and when it halts, the air quivers under its weight.
- **Disposition:** The Ironscourge is a remorseless siege-engine, following its final command with unwavering precision: annihilate resistance. It wades through armies as if they were tall grass, shrugging off steel and arrow alike, advancing without pause. It knows no mercy, no surrender, and no fear. In battle, it adapts, shifting its weight to counter evasive foes, or locking down into siege stance to endure magical bombardment. When it unleashes its full might, the battlefield shatters beneath its fists, as though an entire army marched with it. Only focused lightning strikes have ever slowed its march.

**Abilities**
- **Crushing Blow.** Melee Attack: +38 to hit, 12d12+25 bludgeoning. On a hit, the target must succeed a DC 45 CON save or be stunned until the start of the Ironscourge’s next turn.
- **Siege Mode.** As an action, the Ironscourge locks its stance, reducing its speed to 0. Until the end of its next 2 turns, its AC increases by +10 and it has resistance to all ranged attacks.
- **Titan Slam (Recharge 5–6).** The Ironscourge slams the ground, creating a shockwave in a 60-ft radius. All creatures must make a DC 45 STR save or take 20d12 bludgeoning and be knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage and remain standing.
- **Runic Core (Passive).** While above 50% HP, the Ironscourge regenerates 50 HP at the start of each of its turns. If reduced below 25% HP, its runes overload, causing it to deal double damage on Crushing Blow until destroyed.
