Appearance: The Ironscourge is a hulking war-machine of ancient design, built from dark steel plates, reinforced joints, and arcane pistons that hiss with each thunderous step. Standing three times the height of a man, its massive fists are shaped like piledrivers, and its chest bears a sigil of conquest long forgotten. Its surface is dented and battle-scarred, but no rust touches its frame, runic circuits glow faintly across its body, pulsing with grim mechanical rhythm. When it moves, the ground quakes as if it were dragging the weight of an army with it.
Disposition: Built for sieges and annihilation, the Ironscourge follows only its final directive: destroy all that resists. It is nearly impervious to mundane harm, shrugging off blades and arrows as it advances without emotion or hesitation. Though not truly sentient, it can evaluate threats and adjust tactics mid-combat, deploying crushing force with brutal efficiency. In siege mode, it becomes a near-immovable wall of death, shrugging off volleys while preparing to flatten the battlefield in a single devastating shockwave. Only focused lightning strikes have been shown to slow its iron march.
