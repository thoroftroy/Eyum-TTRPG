- **Appearance:** The Efreeti towers as a monarch of flame, its char-black skin veined with molten cracks that glow like rivers of magma. A crown of living fire hovers above its head, feeding from its fury, and brass armor etched with thousands of contracts shifts and burns as though freshly forged. Every step leaves glassed sand behind, every breath carries the scent of cinnamon, smoke, and molten iron. Its eyes blaze with cruel intelligence, and its laughter is a furnace roar.
- **Disposition:** Efreeti are merchant-kings and tyrant warlords, creatures who honor deals only to twist them later into shackles. They dominate not only by power but by manipulation, binding mortals into servitude with contracts etched in fire. In combat they fight as theatrical executioners, dividing the battlefield with roaring infernos, isolating targets for capture, and scorching the rest into submission. They revel in spectacle, savoring both the fear they inspire and the clever foes who live long enough to become useful thralls.

- **Inferno (Recharge 5–6).** The Efreeti unleashes a 40-ft radius of searing flame within 150 ft. All creatures must succeed on a DC 44 DEX save or take 12d12 fire damage (half on success). Structures in the area ignite instantly.
- **Blazing Mirage (Passive).** The battlefield within 30 ft of the Efreeti is distorted with heat. All ranged attacks against it are made with disadvantage, and creatures treat the area as lightly obscured.
- **Commanding Presence.** Once per round as a bonus action, the Efreeti may force a creature within 30 ft that can see it to make a DC 42 WIS save or become Charmed until the end of its next turn. While charmed, the target cannot attack the Efreeti.
