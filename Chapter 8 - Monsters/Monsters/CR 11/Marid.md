- **Appearance:** The Marid manifests as a towering figure of living ocean, its skin the green-blue jade of storm-lit depths. Its beard and hair surge as constant currents, no matter the air around it, and every gesture leaves salt mist and the hush of waves. Shells and pearls adorn its watery frame, ringing like temple chimes. The ground under its presence grows damp, while the air tastes faintly of brine and thunder.
- **Disposition:** The Marid is a courtly storm given flesh. Proud but not cruel, it insists on courtesy in word and deed—yet when crossed, it unleashes oceanic wrath. It conjures towering tides to scatter formations, drowns archers in crushing spheres of water, and dashes frontlines apart with tidal force. Those who parley may find it gracious; those who mock it will vanish beneath the tide.
