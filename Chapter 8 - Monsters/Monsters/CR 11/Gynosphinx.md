- **Appearance:** The Gynosphinx towers as a leonine colossus crowned with wings of radiant gold and a face as serene as carved marble. Her braids are threaded with gems that glow faintly with celestial fire, and her feathers sparkle with gold-dust motes that drift into the air as she moves. Her eyes are twin stars, luminous and unyielding, piercing even the deepest dark. Every step carries an aura of inevitability, and her voice thrums with timeless weight, like prophecy wrapped in riddle.
- **Disposition:** Keeper of divine riddles and forbidden lore, the Gynosphinx is a gate and a test. She offers choice before conflict: solve her challenge or face her wrath. She wields her power with precision, binding intruders with words of geas and scattering armies with a roar that echoes across eternity. She is neither cruel nor merciful—her only loyalty is to the protection of secrets. When pressed, she unleashes her claws with surgical ferocity, teleporting through space and illusion alike to control the field. To challenge her knowledge is to gamble one’s soul against aeons of wisdom.
