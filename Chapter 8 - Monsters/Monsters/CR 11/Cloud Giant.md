- **Speed:** 50 ft
- **Size:** Huge (18–21 ft tall, 8,000–12,000 lbs)
- **Appearance:** Cloud Giants tower like aristocrats carved from sky itself. Their marble-pale skin shimmers with an opalescent sheen, while robes of woven mist swirl with hues of sunrise. Silver bracelets crackle faintly with static, and their hair drifts as though in a constant unseen breeze. Their eyes mirror the sky’s mood—bright azure in peace, storm-gray when stirred to wrath. Their very presence is lofty, as though the air thins around them, setting mortals gasping beneath the weight of altitude.
- **Disposition:** Lords of high castles and endless skies, Cloud Giants fight with elegance and precision. They rarely waste blows, preferring to hurl boulders that shepherd enemies into killing grounds they prepare with their control of wind and fog. In battle, they keep their height advantage, stepping sideways onto balconies of conjured cloudstuff to command the battlefield with vantage. Cruelty does not drive them, but supremacy does—when the fight grows crude, they disengage skyward, waiting until they can descend on terms of their choosing.

- **Step on the Breeze.** As a bonus action, the giant may shift 40 ft straight up or down, ignoring opportunity attacks, and leaving behind a 10 ft cloud of mist that grants heavy obscurement until the start of its next turn.
- **Sky Sovereignty (Aura, 40 ft).** Enemies treat the area within 40 ft as difficult terrain unless they can fly. Any ranged attack targeting the Cloud Giant from outside this aura is made at disadvantage.
