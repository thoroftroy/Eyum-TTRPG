Appearance: Marble-pale skin with opal sheen, robes woven from mist and dyed in sunrise colors. Bracelets of gleaming silver crackle faintly as they move; hair floats with its own breeze. Their eyes reflect skies—storm-gray when angered, bright blue at ease.  
Disposition: Aristocrats of altitude. A cloud giant toys with range, throwing boulders to steer foes into open “courtyards,” then closing in with courtly brutality. It values position above bloodlust—stepping sideways onto balconies of conjured fog to keep advantage while it reads the whole battlefield. If the fight grows crude, it disengages vertically and starts over on its terms.
