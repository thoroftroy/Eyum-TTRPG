- **Appearance:** The Djinni appears as a towering sapphire-skinned noble, its muscular upper body adorned with golden jewelry that hums with harmonic resonance, while its lower half swirls into a storm of perfumed vapor. Each movement trails a ribbon of mist that sparkles faintly like moonlight on water, and its eyes glow like azure lanterns. When it speaks, its voice echoes as though carried from domes and tiled halls, commanding reverence and dread alike. The air bends around it, pressure shifting as if the wind itself bows to its presence.
- **Disposition:** Proud, mercurial, and bound by ancient codes of hospitality, the Djinni may enter as a courteous host, offering riddles or tasks to test worth. Yet insult or defiance turns its grace into wrath, and the storm answers. In battle, it fights as both duelist and tempest, soaring above foes while conjuring cyclones to scatter formations. It delights in humiliating enemies, battering them with whirling winds and imprisoning them in tempests until pride breaks. Though it favors capture over slaughter, once its honor is stained it becomes a whirlwind of scimitars and storm.
