Appearance: Sapphire-skinned nobles wreathed in perfumed vapor, lower bodies spiraling into storm mist. Jewelry hums like singing bowls; speech echoes as if spoken from a tiled dome.  
Disposition: Duelists of hospitality and pride. A djinni offers courtesy, then tests the party’s grace with riddled tasks; insult turns wind to knives. In open combat it rides the air, slicing with scimitars while whirlwinds pin foes who dare to jump. It prefers nonlethal humiliation over death, but will banish brutes into tempests without remorse.
