- **Type:** Elemental
- **CR:** 11
- **AC:** 52
- **HP:** 2,432 (64d12+1,536)
- **Vitality:** 1,080 (48d10+576)
- **Speed:** 40 ft, Burrow 60 ft
- **Size:** Large (10–12 ft tall, lower body of packed sand)
- **Appearance:** The Dao manifests as a towering, jewel-studded colossus whose lower half spirals endlessly into compressed gravel and living stone. Gold-leaf sigils orbit its wrists, glowing faintly with geomantic power, while every movement shakes loose rivulets of sand and pebbles that trail in its wake. Its grinding voice echoes like millstones turning in deep caverns, and the air around it carries the scent of hot dust, scorched earth, and cardamom. When it descends into battle, the ground itself bends to its will, reshaping terrain into traps, walls, and shifting dunes.
- **Disposition:** Pragmatic and calculating, the Dao is not a mindless brute but a contractor of earth’s might. It prefers to entomb foes alive, collapsing caverns or sealing doors behind waves of stone rather than spilling unnecessary blood. Patient and cruel, it wears enemies down step by step, forcing them uphill into exhaustion while the battlefield itself becomes a cage. It values capture and ransom above slaughter, but once provoked into fury, it becomes a living avalanche that buries all in its path.

**Abilities**
- **Maul.** Melee Attack: +36 to hit, reach 20 ft, 12d12+28 bludgeoning. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 40 STR save or be knocked prone and buried in shifting rubble, taking 4d12 additional bludgeoning at the start of its next turn.
- **Stonefold (Recharge 5–6).** The Dao folds terrain into its grasp. All creatures in a 40-ft radius within 60 ft must succeed on a DC 40 STR save or be Restrained as the ground clamps and twists around them. Restrained creatures take 8d10 bludgeoning damage at the start of their turn. Escape DC 40.
- **Seismic Rupture (1/day).** The Dao slams the ground, creating a shockwave in a 60-ft radius. All creatures must succeed on a DC 40 DEX save or take 15d12 bludgeoning and be knocked prone. Structures collapse automatically in the affected area.
- **Burrow Sovereign (Passive).** The Dao ignores all terrain restrictions when burrowing and can move through solid stone as though it were air. When moving through stone, it may choose to leave a 10-ft-wide tunnel or collapse its passage instantly.
