Appearance: A living siege tower of horn and corded muscle, its bull-like head framed by spiraling, stone-scarred horns. Hide like kiln-fired clay is split by fault lines glowing the color of banked embers; each breath vents heat that ripples torchlight. Iron rings pierce its forearms and shoulders where chains once tried—and failed—to hold it. Its hoofprints are cratered crescents that fill with dust; its stench mixes animal musk with the iron tang of demolished gates. Across its chest, scarified sigils of conquest have been clawed over into chaos, as if even the act of being named was an insult it could not tolerate.  
Disposition: Brute shock-trooper that thinks in straight lines and collapsing walls. A goristro **makes** a charge lane with shoulders and horns, plowing through cover so the battlefield becomes narrow, brutal, and its own. It targets the heaviest armor first—the better to humiliate a “champion”—then uses reach to keep rescuers off. If kited, it smashes pillars to drop ceilings, turning pursuit into a cave-in race. Retreat is not in its script; only disorientation (blinding, labyrinthine terrain) pauses its advance, and even then it paces like an earthquake waiting for the next crack.

Run-Through (Recharge 5–6): The goristro moves up to 40 ft in a straight line, passing through hostile spaces. Each creature it moves through makes a DC 19 STR save or is knocked prone and takes **5d12** bludgeoning (half and no prone on success).
