- **Appearance:** The Colossus is a towering elemental force, carved from living stone, flame-wreathed metal, and glacial ice, its form shifting subtly as if all elements exist within it simultaneously. Its eyes burn like dying stars, and each movement sends cracks through the ground, accompanied by the echo of distant thunder. Moss, magma, and crystal cling to its surface like a living mantle, and its voice, if ever heard, is a tremor through the bones rather than the air. When it lifts its massive fists, even mountains seem to brace.
- **Disposition:** The Colossus is not a guardian, nor a destroyer, it is a consequence. Awakened only when balance is shattered or elemental forces surge out of control, it moves with slow, deliberate purpose, as if aware that each step reshapes the world. While not malicious, it is utterly unrelenting in its path, often unaware of the destruction it causes in pursuit of its unknowable objective. Against those who resist, it brings the wrath of tectonic fury and storm-forged resilience, shrugging off mortal efforts like a landslide shrugs off stone. Only powerful disruption, particularly thunderous force, can fracture its momentum.
