- **Appearance:** Blackened plate engraved with oaths scored out by a claw; a ragged plume trails embers. Its eyes glow like furnace-coals through a visor that never lifts. An aura of cold authority clings to it—orders more than words.
- **Disposition:** Duellist-general. It challenges the strongest, forcing champions to commit while its aura rots courage from the rest. It punishes spellcasting with sudden pressure and never lets a healer work in peace. If outmaneuvered, it withdraws a dozen paces, reorders the field with barked commands, then crashes the flank that moved last.
