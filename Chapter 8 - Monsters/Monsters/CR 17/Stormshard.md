- **Appearance:** The Stormshard appears as a humanoid figure composed of crackling storm-energy, armored in segmented plates of ionized crystal and flowing robes of shifting cloudstuff. Arcs of lightning leap from its shoulders with each movement, and its voice rumbles like distant thunder when it speaks, or roars. Its blade is forged from condensed skyfire, pulsing with barely restrained power, and its eyes are twin vortices of swirling wind and stormlight. The air around it trembles constantly, and its very presence makes it feel like the calm just before catastrophe.
- **Disposition:** Stormshards serve as eternal sentinels of balance in the elemental skies, avatars of judgment and retribution wielded by ancient forces or tempest-bound pacts. They act with measured wrath, delivering destruction only when provoked or commanded, but their fury is absolute once unleashed. Moving with the precision of lightning and the relentlessness of a stormfront, they strike down enemies before they can retaliate, weaving between attacks with the grace of wind incarnate. Their dominion over weather shields them from distant harm, and even the bravest archers find their arrows lost in the storm that follows them.
