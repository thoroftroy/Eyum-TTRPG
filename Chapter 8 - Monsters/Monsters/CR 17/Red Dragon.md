Appearance: A walking furnace of hatred and hunger. Plates of blackened crimson overlap like roof tiles fired in a kiln; heat shimmers off its belly scales even in snow. Horns curl back in scorched ivory ridges, and each exhale carries cinders that skitter across stone before winking out. Its roosts are galleries of ruin—slagged gold, glassed sand, and murals of soot where flame licked the walls.  
Disposition: An apex tyrant that treats the battlefield as a forge. It opens with a strafing pass of fire to break formation, then chooses a champion to humiliate in melee while the rest watch. It values spectacle and terror as weapons—circling high to force the party to waste resources, dive-bombing only when someone is isolated or panicking. When truly threatened, it collapses chokepoints with its bulk, herds prey into kill-cones, and retreats only to burn the countryside into bargaining chips.
