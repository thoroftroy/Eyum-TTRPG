Appearance: Six-armed general of spite—emerald scales, a crown of horn, and six blades that sing different notes when drawn. Incense and blood cling to her like perfume.  
Disposition: She choreographs combat. The marilith locks the front line with a tangle of blades, tail-wraps anyone who slips past, and counterpivots to place allies into flanking triangles. She punishes spellcasting with feints and readied strikes, and if pressed, she vanishes in a blur to reappear where the formation is weakest.
