- **Appearance:** The Dreadforged is an immense figure encased in blackened armor etched with runes that pulse with crimson light. Its helm reveals no face, only a deep void from which flickers of green flame and whispers of the damned emerge. Its greatsword is a towering slab of cursed steel, glowing faintly with necrotic energy and leaving trails of ash with every swing. Each step it takes leaves a scar upon the earth, and the weight of its presence alone seems to bend the air with dread.
- **Disposition:** Once a titan-blessed warlord who fell in a pact-bound betrayal, the Dreadforged rises from its tomb with vengeance and hatred forged into its very bones. It exists only to conquer, marching without rest or remorse, cleaving through battalions with each sweep of its blade. Even death does not end its fury, when its body fails, its soul claws its way back into form, rising again in a blaze of undeath. It is cunning in battle, brutal in execution, and relentless in its pursuit. Only the most powerful radiant forces can sever the tether that binds it to the world.
