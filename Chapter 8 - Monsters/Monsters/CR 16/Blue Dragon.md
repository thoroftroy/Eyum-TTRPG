Appearance: A desert thunderhead given scales—sapphire plates veined with pale lightning scars. Its horns sweep forward like paired scimitars, and the membranes of its wings are crosshatched from sandstorms. When it speaks, dust lifts from the ground in little whirlwinds.  
Disposition: Patient, territorial hunter of open skies. It circles at extreme altitude until the party exposes a weakness, then lashes down in a crackling dive to obliterate a single target with lightning before tunneling into dunes to reset the fight. It manipulates line-of-sight with ridgelines and half-buried ruins, forcing enemies into a deadly straightaway where its breath can scythe them in a line.
