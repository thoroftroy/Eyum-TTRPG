Appearance: The Mindreaver is a towering, robed figure whose form seems to bend perception itself, its limbs elongate and contract subtly when unobserved, and its silhouette shimmers like a mirage on the edge of comprehension. Its face is a mask of shifting geometry, with countless eyes blinking across its surface in patterns that defy logic. When it speaks, it does so with a dozen voices at once, some distant, some whispering, and some echoing from within your own mind. Veins of violet energy pulse through its robes like living circuitry, feeding on thought and fear.
Disposition: Mindreavers are agents of madness sent forth from deep rifts in reality, harbingers of unraveling sentience. Highly intelligent and terrifyingly composed, they do not act on impulse, they orchestrate. Each encounter is a psychological war, with the Mindreaver unraveling its foes' confidence, memory, and will before striking with devastating psychic force. Its presence warps reason, dulls clarity, and breeds doubt. It is said that even if one survives the Mindreaver, they never again sleep without hearing its voice in the dark corners of their thoughts.
