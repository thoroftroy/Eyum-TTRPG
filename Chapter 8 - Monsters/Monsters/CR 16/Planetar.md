Appearance: Verdigris-green skin, feathered wings that shimmer like oil on water, and eyes like polished jade that see through lies to intention. Armor appears as layered light; its sword hums with hymns only the guilty hear. Wherever it treads, dust settles, wounds close a little easier, and torches burn without smoke.  
Disposition: Mercy held in mailed fist. A planetar calls for surrender once; if refused, it cuts diagonally through the line to behead the sin it has judged, then spends the rest of its turn saving who can be saved—dragging the penitent out of fire, interposing wing and blade against the next blow. If an enemy yields, it would rather bind them to restitution than execution.
