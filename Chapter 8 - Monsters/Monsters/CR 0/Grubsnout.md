- **Appearance:** Grubsnouts are plump, mole-like creatures with wrinkled gray skin, oversized front claws, and a fleshy snout that twitches constantly as they root through soil. Their eyes are nearly vestigial, leaving them almost blind, but their sense of smell and vibration detection is exceptionally keen. They leave winding tunnels close to the surface, causing soft earth and collapsed patches where travelers’ feet may sink unexpectedly. Their constant chittering squeaks echo faintly through the ground, often betraying their presence.
- **Disposition:** Non-aggressive and primarily interested in worms, roots, and fungi. Grubsnouts scatter when threatened but may lash out with frantic claw swipes if cornered. Farmers find them both pests and blessings: destructive to crops yet excellent at aerating fields.
