- **Appearance:** Guzze are squat, round-bodied flying creatures with oversized leathery wings that seem far too big for their pudgy frames. Their faces resemble a blend of bat and frog, with bulging eyes, wide grinning mouths full of tiny flat teeth, and a long, sticky tongue they use to grab food mid-flight. Their wings beat erratically, making them wobble and dip through the air in unpredictable patterns. Despite their clumsy flight, Guzze can hover and dart quickly when startled. Their skin is rubbery and comes in shades of mottled gray, green, or pale brown, often blending into rocky cliff sides where they roost.
- **Disposition:** Generally harmless scavengers, Guzze gather in noisy flocks around refuse, carrion, or unattended food. They squabble constantly, shrieking at one another in high-pitched squeals. Though not aggressive, they may dive-bomb intruders to scare them off or nip at food being carried. Villagers dislike their presence, considering them pests, but alchemists occasionally prize their tongues and wings as reagents for potions of levitation or stickiness.
