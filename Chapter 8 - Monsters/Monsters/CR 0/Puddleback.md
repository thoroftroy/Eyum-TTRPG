- **Appearance:** Puddlebacks are squat, amphibian-like creatures with slick, mottled blue-green skin and broad, flat tails that help them swim in shallow waters. Their backs are covered in bumpy ridges that ooze a harmless but foul-smelling slime, deterring most predators. They have wide mouths lined with tiny nubs instead of teeth, perfect for gulping insects and pond weeds. When on land, they waddle clumsily, leaving wet streaks wherever they go. Their croaks are low, gurgling sounds that resonate loudly at dusk, often mistaken for bubbling bogs.
- **Disposition:** Puddlebacks are docile and cowardly, preferring to slip beneath the water or flop into reeds rather than fight. They live in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, often clustering in groups that scatter explosively when disturbed. Fishermen dislike them for fouling nets, but some healers value their slime as a base for salves.
