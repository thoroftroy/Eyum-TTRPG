- **Appearance:** Twigskitters are wiry, insect-like vermin with elongated sticklike bodies and spindly legs that let them blend seamlessly into underbrush or deadwood. Their mottled brown and green carapaces resemble broken twigs, making them nearly invisible while still. They have bulbous black eyes and sharp, needle-like mandibles, which they use to nip at bark or unsuspecting pests. When moving, they scuttle in rapid, jittery bursts that make them unsettling to watch.
- **Disposition:** Naturally skittish and non-confrontational, Twigskitters flee at the first sign of larger creatures. They are often mistaken for dead twigs until disturbed, at which point they scatter in chaotic swarms. Though harmless, their tendency to infest woodpiles and houses makes them a common nuisance. Druids occasionally keep them in jars, as their molted shells are prized for camouflage charms.
