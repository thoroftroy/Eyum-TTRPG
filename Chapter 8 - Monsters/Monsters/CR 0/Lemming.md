Appearance: Lemmings in Eyum are fuzzy, rotund critters that resemble a walking fluffball with a yellow beak awkwardly poking out of their dense fur. They stand 1-2 feet tall and waddle with surprising urgency on thin, spindly legs. Though harmless, they are notoriously stubborn and known to follow simple paths to their end, often straight off ledges or into rivers, with zero hesitation. Lemmings tend to live in burrows beneath hillsides and travel in noisy, bumbling groups that bump into travelers and objects with curious, erratic persistence. 
Disposition: They are not hostile unless cornered or terrified, at which point they may charge in confusion using their “Bump” attack. Even then, they do more tripping than true damage. Many villagers in Eyum view lemmings as omens of poor harvests or mild madness, though druids consider them important ground churners for the ecosystem.
