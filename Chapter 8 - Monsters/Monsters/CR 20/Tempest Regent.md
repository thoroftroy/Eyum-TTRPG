Appearance: A sovereign thunderhead in human outline, ribs lit by chain lightning that writes cursive across a heart of blue-white ice. Rain beads into orbiting pearls; gusts comb banners into streamers that point toward the eye. Where it drifts, iron tastes sweeter, hair stands accusingly, and old weathervanes bow like courtiers.  
Disposition: Meteorology as war. The Regent fights by drafting a micro-climate: a windwall here, a pressure ridge there, a low roll of thunder that convinces your knees to misbehave. It lives in the vertical—knives down, knives up, and the party torn between sky and earth until choices split and someone is alone. If caged, it breathes in the cage and exhales a new horizon.

Stormlance: Ranged Spell Attack +18 to hit (120 ft), **12d10** lightning; hit → speed reduced by 10 ft until end of next turn.  
Maelstrom Crown (Recharge 5–6): 30-ft-radius dome centered on the Regent. Foes inside make a DC **24** STR save or are lifted 20 ft, **Restrained** in the gale (escape DC 24), and take **4d10** thunder at the start of their turns (half and no restrain on success).  
Downburst: As a reaction to being hit by a ranged attack, impose disadvantage on that attack and push the attacker 10 ft.
