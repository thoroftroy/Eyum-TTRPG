- **Appearance:** A sovereign thunderhead shaped in human outline, ribs lit by chain lightning scrawling across a frozen heart. Rain beads orbit like pearls, gusts drag banners into streamers, and old weathervanes bow wherever it passes.
- **Disposition:** Meteorology as war. The Regent drafts battlefields into climates—walls of wind, ridges of pressure, and thunder that tricks knees into kneeling. It owns the vertical: blades of lightning above and below, forcing the party to split between ground and sky. If caged, it exhales new horizons.

**Abilities**
- **Stormlance.** Ranged Spell Attack: +66 to hit, range 300 ft, one target. Hit: **45d12 lightning**. Target must succeed on a DC **97 CON save** or be **Paralyzed** until the end of its next turn; on success, target’s speed is reduced by 30 ft until the end of its next turn.
- **Maelstrom Crown (Recharge 5–6).** A 200-ft-radius storm dome forms around the Regent. Each foe inside must succeed on a DC **98 STR save** or be lifted 100 ft into the air, become **Restrained** (escape DC 98), and take **25d12 thunder** at the start of each of their turns. On success, they take half damage and are not restrained.
- **Downburst (Reaction).** When hit by a ranged attack, the Regent imposes **Disadvantage** on the attack roll and forces the attacker to succeed on a DC **95 STR save** or be pushed 60 ft away and knocked **Prone**.
- **Cyclonic Dominion (Passive).** All terrain within 500 ft counts as **difficult terrain** for enemies. Projectiles fired through the storm have **Disadvantage**. At the start of each of the Regent’s turns, one enemy of choice within 300 ft must succeed on a DC **95 DEX save** or be struck by stray lightning for **15d12 lightning**.
- **Cataclysm Front (Recharge 6).** The Regent summons an apocalyptic stormfront. All enemies within 500 ft must make a DC **98 CON save** or take **80d12 lightning + 80d12 thunder**, half on success. All flying creatures that fail the save are slammed to the ground and knocked **Prone**.
