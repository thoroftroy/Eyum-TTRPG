Appearance: Solcryst is a radiant figure of golden armor and living sunlight, its form encased in flawless crystalline plating that pulses with celestial energy. Wings of burning brilliance extend from its back, not feathered but composed of interlocking beams of pure light that shimmer and refract with every movement. Its eyes are molten gold, and its voice carries the calm gravity of dawn and the fury of high noon. When it draws its solar blade, it ignites the battlefield in a corona of divine presence, driving back shadow with every step.
Disposition: Solcrysts are the high sentinels of celestial realms, eternal champions who guard sacred thresholds, banish abyssal forces, and answer the prayers of the desperate. Noble beyond mortal reckoning, they act not out of pride or vengeance, but from perfect, unwavering purpose. They protect without hesitation, strike with unerring clarity, and embody the judgment and mercy of the divine sun. In battle, they radiate both power and calm, shielding allies while disintegrating foes in incandescent waves of justice. Only necrotic magic dares to mar their light, for even death recoils at their brilliance.
