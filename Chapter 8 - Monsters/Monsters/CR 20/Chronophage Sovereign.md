- **Appearance:** A monarch stitched from torn calendars and gilt hour-hands, robes woven from midnight between seconds. A crown of broken clock faces rotates in perpetual disagreement above its skull. Its scythe of jointed metronomes ticks in rhythm with the battlefield’s pulse. Candles burn backward, ink un-writes, and words arrive before their speakers—time itself falters at its presence.
- **Disposition:** Editor of causality. The Sovereign does not clash—it rehearses, revises, and replays. First it strips tempo: erasing reactions, devouring bonus actions, or removing an entire round. Then it excises individuals from history. Cornering it is futile, as it steps out into the second that never was.

**Abilities**
- **Scythe of Hours.** Melee +58 to hit, **50d12+55 slashing + 20d12 necrotic**. On crit, the target must succeed on a DC **96 CON save** or lose its next turn entirely (time skipped).
- **Steal the Second (Recharge 5–6).** 120-ft radius; creatures of choice must succeed on a DC **95 WIS save** or lose **Reactions, Bonus Actions, and Legendary Actions** until end of next turn, taking **25d12 psychic**. Success → half damage only.
- **Cut From Time (3/day).** One creature within 120 ft makes a DC **95 CHA save**. On fail, it vanishes from reality until the start of the Sovereign’s next turn (no actions, untargetable, reappears in same or nearest safe space).
- **Temporal Collapse (Recharge 6).** The Sovereign rewinds 1 round. All creatures in a 300-ft radius repeat their last turn but suffer **20d12 psychic** backlash and must reroll any successful saves with Disadvantage.
- **Causality Editor (Passive).** Whenever the Sovereign would be reduced below half HP, it rewinds itself to the start of the previous round (once per combat).
