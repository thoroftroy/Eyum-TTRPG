Appearance: A monarch stitched from torn calendars and gilt hour-hands, robes woven from midnight between seconds. Its skull is crowned with a ring of broken clock faces that rotate in disagreement. A scythe of jointed metronomes ticks in accelerating sympathy with nearby heartbeats. In its presence, candles burn backward, ink un-writes, and spoken words arrive before their speakers.  
Disposition: Editor of causality. It never contests strength; it **rehearses** defeat and then plays it back. It steals the party’s tempo first—denying reactions, swallowing bonus actions, erasing the round you needed—then cuts the loudest threat out of the sequence entirely. When cornered, it rewinds the room to before the corner existed and steps out through the absence.

Steal the Second (Recharge 5–6): 60-ft radius; creatures of choice make a DC **24** WIS save. Fail → lose **Reactions** and **Bonus Actions** until end of next turn and take **6d10** psychic; success → half damage only.  
Cut From Time (1/day): One creature the Sovereign can see within 60 ft must make a DC **24** CHA save or vanish until the end of its next turn (no actions, no presence; returns in the same space or nearest safe).
