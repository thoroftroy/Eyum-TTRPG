Speed: 40 ft  
Size: Huge  
Height: 20–24 ft  
Weight: 20–30 tons  
Appearance: A titan of sliding plates and revolving arches, each surface carved with floor plans from cities that never were. Its eyes are compass roses; its breath smells of chalk and old blueprints. Footfalls stamp tiles that rise into steps, then stairs, then corridors that go where the Prime wishes. Its shadow is always a map—never of here.  
Disposition: Cartographer-killer. The Prime does not pursue; it **re-routes**. It inserts walls between allies, folds floors into ramps that feed you into oubliettes, and pins the brave with the weight of a hallway turned sideways. It prefers captures to kills—each prisoner a guarantee that the party must come deeper, on its terms, along paths it has already solved.  
STR: 28 (+9) | DEX: 16 (+3) | CON: 30 (+10) | INT: 18 (+4) | WIS: 18 (+4) | CHA: 16 (+3)  
Resistances: Physical (non-magical), Psychic  
Weaknesses: Thunder  
Abilities:  
Architect’s Hammer: Melee Attack +18 to hit, **12d10+9** bludgeoning; on hit, raise a 5-ft-thick wall panel adjacent to the target (AC 18, 40 HP) that grants the Prime half cover until destroyed.  
Maze Pulse (Recharge 5–6): 60-ft cone; creatures make a DC **24** INT save or are **Banished** into a sub-maze (speed 0, can take actions but can’t affect the battlefield) until they succeed on a DC **24** INT check at the end of their turns to escape.  
Redirect Path: As a reaction when a creature within 30 ft would move, force a DC **24** WIS save or turn the movement up to 90°.
