Appearance: The Thunderborn Drake is a sleek, serpentine dragon with scales the color of storm clouds and veins of flickering blue lightning coursing beneath its hide. Its wings crackle with static as they beat, leaving flashes of light in their wake, and its horns arc backward like jagged lightning rods. Sparks trail from its claws and nostrils as it moves, and its roar is often mistaken for distant thunder, rolling across hills and valleys. During flight, it seems to ride on the storm itself, each wingbeat stirring the clouds above.
Disposition: Proud and tempestuous, Thunderborn Drakes are solitary tyrants of stormy peaks, coastal cliffs, and wind-lashed highlands. Though not cruel by nature, they are aggressive, territorial, and fiercely protective of their dominion. They attack swiftly and decisively when threatened, using their storm-borne powers to overwhelm prey and invaders alike. Their mastery over weather lets them call down thunder and shield themselves in lightning-charged air, becoming almost untouchable when the sky is dark. Hunters speak of the eerie calm that precedes their approach, and the storm that always follows.
