- **Appearance:** The Thunderborn Drake is a sleek, serpentine dragon clad in stormcloud-colored scales, with veins of blue lightning arcing beneath its hide. Its wings crackle with static, leaving flashes of light with every beat, while its horns jut backward like jagged lightning rods. Sparks cascade from its nostrils and claws, and its roar resounds like rolling thunder across valleys. When it soars, it appears to ride the storm itself, drawing clouds and lightning in its wake.
- **Disposition:** Proud, tempestuous, and fiercely territorial, the Thunderborn Drake rules storm-wracked peaks and coastal cliffs. It is not inherently cruel, but its aggression is swift and absolute when its domain is threatened. It strikes with the fury of a tempest, overwhelming foes in storms of lightning and thunder. Its mastery over weather makes it nearly unassailable beneath darkened skies, where hunters speak of eerie calm before its arrival—and ruin in the storm it summons.
