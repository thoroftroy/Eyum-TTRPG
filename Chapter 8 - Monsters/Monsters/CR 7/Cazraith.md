- **Appearance:** A Cazratih resembles a half-dissolved humanoid silhouette, its body unraveling into tendrils of phantasmal smoke and flickering threads of thought. Its limbs stretch and contract in unnatural spasms, and its vertical maw opens with a chorus of layered, reversed whispers. Rings of faint, blinking lights orbit it, pulsing in irregular rhythms with each movement. The air hums faintly around it, static and dissonant, leaving unease in all who linger nearby.
- **Disposition:** Cazratihs are ancient dream-fragments from dying realms, drifting between realities. They speak in riddles, often vanishing mid-sentence, and strike suddenly when their broken logic compels it. They prefer to disable, confuse, and disorient their foes rather than kill outright, leaving survivors fractured, haunted, and unstable. Their presence alone gnaws at the minds of mortals, unraveling thoughts like loose threads.
