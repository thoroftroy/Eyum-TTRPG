Appearance: A Cazraith resembles a half-dissolved humanoid shadow, its body flickering with phantasmal smoke and threads of visible thought. Its limbs stretch and contract unnaturally, and its mouth splits vertically. Its voice sounds like multiple whispers layered in reverse. It is ringed by faint, blinking lights that pulse with each step it takes, and it leaves behind a static hum in the air.
Disposition: Cazraiths are ancient dream-fragments, wanderers from dying realms. They speak in riddles, vanish mid-sentence, and attack without warning when their logic deems it necessary. Their presence causes unease in all nearby beings, even when not aggressive. Cazraiths prefer to disable, confuse, and disorient their enemies, often leaving survivors with fractured memory.
