- **Vitality:** 284 (22d10+132)
- **Speed:** 50 ft

- **Appearance:** The Fellgrin is a monstrous quadruped, its bulk warped by rot and elemental corruption. Its cracked hide seeps sour smoke from moss-lined scars, and its massive tusks curve like jagged scythes, etched with glowing natural runes that pulse when it charges. Its black, depthless eyes burn with an endless fury, and each hoofstep leaves scorched, blighted soil in its wake.
- **Disposition:** Berserk scavengers of corrupted valleys, Fellgrins consume everything—beast, carrion, or intruder. They charge with terrifying force, shattering terrain and crushing prey beneath tusks that radiate foul energy. While cunning enough to avoid simple traps, their rage overrides all reason once blood is drawn. To many death-worshiping cults, Fellgrins are not beasts, but incarnations of forest decay and inevitability.
