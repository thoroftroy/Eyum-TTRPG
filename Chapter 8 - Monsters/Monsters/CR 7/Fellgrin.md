Appearance: The Fellgrin is a tusked quadruped that resembles a dire boar warped by elemental rot. Its hide is cracked and steaming, streaked with mossy growth and scars that leak sour smoke. Two massive curving tusks jut from its lower jaw, each etched with natural runes that pulse when it charges. Its eyes are black and depthless, and its hooves leave behind scorched soil.
Disposition: Fellgrins are berserk scavengers that roam desolated forests and corrupted valleys, consuming anything remotely edible, living or dead. They attack anything that enters their domain, even overwhelming foes, using brutal charges and terrain-smashing strength. While intelligent enough to avoid obvious traps, their wrath overrides reason once blood is drawn. They are symbols of decay and endurance, and some cults revere them as forest death spirits.
