- **Type:** Monstrosity
- **CR:** 7
- **AC:** 37
- **HP:** 488 (28d12+252)
- **Vitality:** 276 (20d10+140)
- **Speed:** 40 ft, Fly 70 ft
- **Size:** Large (5–6 ft at shoulder, 12–14 ft long, 1,000–1,400 lbs)
- **Appearance:** A hulking fusion of lion, goat, and dragon, its three snarling heads writhe in constant discord. The lion’s golden mane is scorched black at the tips, the goat’s soot-stained horns curve like jagged obsidian, and the dragon’s scaled muzzle smolders with inner fire, its whiskers crackling with sparks. The creature’s body is a mass of brute muscle and scar tissue, its talons gouging the ground as if the earth itself shrinks from it.
- **Disposition:** A violent opportunist that thrives on chaos. It opens with the dragon’s breath to scatter formations, then lunges with the lion’s jaws and claws to crush the weakest foe, while the goat’s horns batter flankers. Territorial and prideful, it retreats only when grounded, badly bloodied, or overwhelmed.
