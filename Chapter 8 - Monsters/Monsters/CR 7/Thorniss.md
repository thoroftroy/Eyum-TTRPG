Appearance: The Thorniss is a mobile thorned horror, part bramblewolf, part humanoid tree. Its limbs are twisted vines sharpened into blades, and its face is a mask of thorned roots with a single amber eye pulsing at its center. Fungal growths dot its shoulders and release glittering spores when damaged.
Disposition: A Thorniss is not so much alive as it is a fungal hive given direction. It exists to protect corrupted groves and overgrown ruins, operating with tactical malice. It strikes quickly, retreats into overgrowth, and ambushes again. Thorniss do not roar or speak. They vibrate lowly and react violently to fire or radiant energy.
