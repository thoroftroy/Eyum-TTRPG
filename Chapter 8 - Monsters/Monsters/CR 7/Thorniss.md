- **Appearance:** The Thorniss is a towering, mobile bramble-horror, equal parts humanoid tree and lupine predator. Its limbs are gnarled vines honed into jagged blades, and its face is a mask of root-thorns pierced by a single amber eye that pulses with fungal light. Fungal blooms sprout across its shoulders and back, releasing glittering spore clouds when it is struck. Its body shifts with unsettling silence, vines rustling faintly as if whispering in anticipation of violence.
- **Disposition:** Thorniss are fungal hives given form and malice, guardians of corrupted groves and vine-choked ruins. They strike with surgical cruelty, lashing from cover before melting back into overgrowth. They neither roar nor speak, instead emitting a low, thrumming vibration that unsettles prey. Fire and radiant energy drive them into furious spasms, making them reckless in retaliation.
