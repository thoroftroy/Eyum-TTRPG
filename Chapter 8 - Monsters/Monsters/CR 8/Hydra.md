- **Appearance:** A reeking colossus of swamp muscle, the Hydra towers with five writhing serpent heads, each scarred differently from past battles. Rings of puckered scales mark old regrowths, proof of its regenerative terror. When enraged, its heads whip in unison, spraying blood, bile, and froth across the mire. Its stench is rot and wet scales, and its movements churn swamp water into whirlpools of death.
- **Disposition:** Tyrant of its domain, the Hydra thrashes at anything that spills its blood. It prioritizes those wielding fire or lightning, attacking until they are destroyed. When a head is severed, it enters a frenzy, its new heads sprouting with terrifying speed if unchecked. Few creatures provoke such relentless, multi-headed violence.

- **Unyielding Bulk.** The Hydra has advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone, grappled, or restrained.
