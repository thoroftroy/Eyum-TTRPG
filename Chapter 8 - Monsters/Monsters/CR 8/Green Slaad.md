Appearance: Warted emerald skin over corded, amphibian muscle; a grin full of mismatched teeth and a throat sac that flickers colors with mood. Its claws leave lines that glow briefly, as if reality were thin there. Where it lingers, puddles ripple without wind.  
Disposition: Chaos with purpose. The green slaad probes with idle cruelty, then becomes frighteningly efficient once it smells fear. It likes to isolate one opponent with a teleporting hop and worry them to the edge of death, offering nonsensical bargains mid-fight. When pressed, it vanishes into angles and returns where the party isn’t looking.
