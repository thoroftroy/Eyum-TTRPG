- **Appearance:** The green slaad is a towering amphibian horror, its warted emerald hide stretched over bulging muscle. Its maw splits into a crooked grin lined with mismatched teeth, while its throat sac flickers with swirling colors that betray its chaotic mood. Its claws leave glowing rents in the air itself, as though reality thins at its touch. Puddles ripple in its presence without cause, and light bends subtly when it moves.
- **Disposition:** A predator of chaos with sinister cunning. The green slaad delights in torment, toying with foes through cruel taunts and nonsense bargains whispered mid-battle. It isolates prey with sudden, impossible hops through warped space, worrying them to the brink of death. Its cruelty sharpens into brutal efficiency when it smells fear, vanishing into warped angles only to reappear where it is least expected.
