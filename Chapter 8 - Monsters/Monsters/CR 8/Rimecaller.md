- **Appearance:** The Rimecaller is a drifting humanoid form sculpted from cracking ice and roiling mist. Antler-like shards of frost crown its head, constantly reshaping in jagged, crystalline bursts. Its arms extend into icicle talons that freeze anything they touch, and its voice is a hollow wail, echoing like stormwinds through an endless canyon. Wherever it drifts, snow and frost cling unnaturally, layering terrain in sudden sheets of ice.
- **Disposition:** Manifesting within tundra blizzards and glacial storms, Rimecallers embody balance, enforcing stillness where chaos intrudes. They are not malicious but pitiless, freezing intruders until silence is restored. Patient hunters, they prefer to smother terrain in frost, weakening foes with cold and silence, before striking with lethal precision.
