Appearance: A floating humanoid shape composed entirely of mist and cracking ice, the Rimecaller has antler-like shards extending from a swirling crown of frozen vapor. Its voice echoes like howling wind through a canyon, and its limbs extend into long icicle fingers that freeze what they touch.
Disposition: Rimecallers manifest in storms across tundras and glacial peaks. Neither cruel nor kind, they enforce balance in extreme environments, freezing over intrusions and restoring stillness. They prefer indirect action: blanketing zones in frost, summoning flurries, and watching from afar before striking decisively.
