Appearance: Frost giants are towering, blue-gray warriors with braided white beards frozen into stiff cords and skin marbled like glacier ice. Their armor is a patchwork of cracked plates and polar furs, rimed with hoarfrost that steams when they enter warm air. Massive greataxes are etched with storm runes and chips of obsidian; the edges glitter with frostbite. When they breathe, you hear the rasp of winter wind through crevasses, and the ground creaks under their heel like shifting pack ice.  
Disposition: They fight like avalanches—deliberate, then sudden. A frost giant measures distance with thrown stones, then commits to a crushing charge once a line looks brittle. They prioritize the largest foe or whoever threatens their kin, using reach to deny flanks and hurling enemies from ledges like dislodged cornices. They withdraw only to draw pursuers into whiteout or onto thin ice where a single stomp shatters footing.
