Appearance: A living shadow with manta-wide wings, lamp-yellow eyes on the dorsal ridge, and a belly lined with clutching barbs. In darkness its edges fray and reform; torchlight paints it as a wound in the air. The smell is wet leather left in a cave.  
Disposition: Stage-manager of panic. It silences the back line with a basso moan that vibrates ribs, drops onto the loudest armor, and wraps that target in muffling membrane while whipping its tailspine at rescuers. It is terrified of focused light; if the party brings sunfire, it flees along ceilings and returns only when the lamps die.
