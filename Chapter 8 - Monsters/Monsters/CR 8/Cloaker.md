- **Appearance:** A living shadow unfurls like a manta with wings that fray and reform in darkness, lamp-yellow eyes glaring from its dorsal ridge. Its underside bristles with clutching barbs and jagged ridges, like a cage of bone and leather. In torchlight, it looks like a wound torn in the air, its edges trembling with flickering instability. Its smell is that of wet leather left to rot in caverns.
- **Disposition:** Cloakers are sadistic stage-managers of panic, feeding on fear as much as flesh. They silence back lines with bone-rattling moans, drop onto loudest foes, and wrap them in smothering membranes while lashing at rescuers with tailspines. Terrified of focused light, they flee when confronted by radiant flames, only to return with vengeance once the lamps die.

- **Moan (Recharge 5–6).** The cloaker emits a basso vibration in a 60 ft cone. Each creature must succeed on a DC 25 WIS save or become _Frightened_ until the end of its next turn. On a failed save of 5 or lower, the creature is also _Stunned_ until the start of its next turn.
- **Engulf.** On a successful Bite, the cloaker may grapple and wrap the target (escape DC 25). While wrapped, the creature is _Blinded_ and _Restrained_, and takes 4d10 piercing damage at the start of its turns. Attacks against the cloaker also hit the wrapped target on a roll of 1–5.
- **Living Shadow (Passive).** While in dim light or darkness, the cloaker has advantage on all saving throws and imposes disadvantage on attack rolls against it.
