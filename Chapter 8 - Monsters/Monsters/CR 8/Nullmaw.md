Appearance: The Nullmaw is a towering, six-limbed monstrosity clad in plates of shifting void matter that ripple like oil on water. Its form is barely stable, constantly warping, flickering between dimensions, and leaving trails of gravitational distortion in its wake. A yawning, jagged maw opens in its chest rather than its head, filled with swirling nothingness that devours light and sound alike. Its limbs end in claws shaped like scythes forged from broken stars, and faint whispers follow it as if the void itself murmurs in its shadow.
Disposition: Nullmaws are ancient predators from beyond reality, drawn to places where the veil between realms is thinnest, forgotten altars, dimensional scars, or dying starscapes. Though not inherently malevolent, they act as instruments of unmaking, hunting powerful beings and devouring traces of their essence. They strike with terrifying precision, bending space and rending targets with force that bypasses flesh and strikes at existence itself. Their presence warps gravity, perception, and even memory, and only the searing light of radiant magic can force them fully into this world long enough to be slain.
