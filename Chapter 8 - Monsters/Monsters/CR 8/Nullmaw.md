- **Appearance:** A Nullmaw is a six-limbed aberration cloaked in plates of rippling void matter that shift like oil across broken glass. Its form constantly flickers, phasing between dimensions, leaving behind warping trails of bent gravity. Where a head should be, its chest gapes open with a jagged maw of swirling nothingness, devouring light and sound. Its scythe-like claws shine like shattered fragments of stars, and whispers of the void follow it, echoing from realities that should not be.
- **Disposition:** Nullmaws are instruments of unmaking, predators from beyond reality. They haunt places where the veil is thinnest—forgotten altars, dimensional scars, and dead stars. Not evil, but inevitable, they hunt powerful beings to consume essence itself. Their strikes bypass flesh, rending existence directly. Their presence warps gravity, twists perception, and unravels memory, and only radiant force can lock them into this world long enough to be destroyed.

**Abilities**
- **Void Rend.** Melee Attack: +22 to hit, 6d12+16 force damage. On a critical hit, the target must succeed on a DC 26 CON save or lose 1d4 max HP permanently until restored by _Greater Restoration_ or stronger magic.
- **Shadow Phase (Recharge 5–6).** The Nullmaw teleports up to 80 ft to an unoccupied space it can see, ignoring barriers of up to 10 ft thick. Its next attack this turn has advantage and deals an additional 4d12 necrotic damage.
- **Abyssal Maw (Recharge 6).** The Nullmaw creates a gravitational vortex in a 30 ft radius. All creatures in the area must make a DC 26 STR save or be pulled 20 ft toward the Nullmaw and take 8d12 force damage. On success, they take half damage and are not moved.
- **Gravity Well (Passive).** Nonmagical projectiles within 30 ft of the Nullmaw curve into its orbit and automatically miss. Creatures that start their turn within this radius treat all terrain as difficult terrain.
- **Unstable Form.** When reduced below half HP, the Nullmaw’s body destabilizes. Each creature within 15 ft at the end of its turn must succeed on a DC 25 WIS save or take 4d10 psychic damage as their perception fractures.
