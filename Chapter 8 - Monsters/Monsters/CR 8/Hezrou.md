- **Speed:** 40 ft

- **Appearance:** A hulking toad-ogre caked in slime, its knotty muscles bulge beneath a hide slick with filth. Its tusked grin splits wide to reveal a rotting tongue strung with bone beads, dripping foul ooze. Its breath reeks like a midden pit turned inside out, swarming with flies that follow it as if to worship. Each massive footstep leaves a print that instantly fills with stagnant, brackish water.
- **Disposition:** A brute that thrives on fear and filth. The Hezrou charges headlong into the thickest cluster of foes just to stand in their midst, trusting its bulk, stink, and slime to break their courage. It pins enemies beneath its weight, tears shields from their hands, and revels when blades slip off its slick hide. When prey flees, it pursues without hesitation—like a flood, direct and unstoppable. Only radiant fire or a stronger bully can drive it back.
