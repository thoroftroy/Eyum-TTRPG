Appearance: A toad-ogre of knotty muscle and slime-slick hide, tusked grin split by a rotting tongue studded with bone beads. Its breath is a midden pit turned inside out; flies follow as if it were a pilgrimage. Every footfall leaves a print that fills with foul water.  
Disposition: Bully and breaker. The hezrou charges the thickest cluster just to stand in it, trusting bulk and stink to make heroes flinch. It pins with weight, tears shields from hands, and laughs when blades slip on grease. If a target runs, it pursues like a flood: straight line, straight murder. Only radiant fire or a bigger bully draws it off.
