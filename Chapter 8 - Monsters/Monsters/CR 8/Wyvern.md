- **Appearance:** A Wyvern is a predatory dragon stripped of regal majesty, its sail-ripped wings bristling with scars and its barbed tail twitching like a wasp poised to strike. Its hide is thick with pale markings where old stingers shattered, testament to brutal survival. With a piercing shriek and venom-dripping fangs, it dominates the skies as a terror of cliffs, canyons, and battlefields.
- **Disposition:** Wyverns are sky bullies—aggressive, territorial, and pitiless. They dive and strike with venomous fury, then retreat to high crags to let poison finish the job before circling back to feast. Their hunting is relentless, and few creatures survive once marked by a Wyvern’s sting.
