Appearance: A grotesque blend of spider and man, the Skarnix walks on backward-jointed limbs tipped with claws, with pale eyeless skin stretched over a skeletal frame. Its mouth is vertical and filled with rows of writhing feelers. Veins of black ichor pulse visibly beneath its skin, and it constantly twitches, sensing motion through vibration.
Disposition: Skarnixes are obsessive predators, following prey across weeks and regions without tiring. They favor night hunts and trap setups, often whispering to themselves in forgotten languages. They communicate by vibration and click, and while intelligent, they are psychologically fractured, erratic in speech, obsessive in habit.
