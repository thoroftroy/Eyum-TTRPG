- **Appearance:** The Skarnix is a grotesque melding of spider and man, its limbs long and backward-jointed, ending in twitching claws that dig into stone like knives. Pale, eyeless skin stretches taut over a skeletal frame, veins of black ichor pulsing visibly beneath the surface. Its vertical mouth brims with rows of writhing feelers, twitching constantly in eerie hunger. It moves with jerking spasms, its body vibrating at all times as if tuned to unseen frequencies.
- **Disposition:** Obsessive and fractured, the Skarnix is a relentless predator. It hunts prey for weeks or even months without pause, whispering in dead languages to itself as it stalks. By vibration and clicks it communicates, its mind a patchwork of broken obsessions. It sets traps, strikes from darkness, and toys with fear as much as flesh.
