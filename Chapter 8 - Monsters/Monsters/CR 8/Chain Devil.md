- **Type:** Fiend
- **CR:** 8
- **AC:** 40
- **HP:** 640 (32d12+384)
- **Vitality:** 340 (24d10+120)
- **Speed:** 30 ft
- **Size:** Medium (6–7 ft tall, 180–240 lbs)
- **Appearance:** A gaoler clad in living iron, its pale flesh threaded with rust-stained chains that rattle with every movement. Hooks click like jagged teeth across its body, and stamped faces twist in its padlocks—some weeping molten rust, others locked in silent laughter. Its presence reeks of cold iron and incense gone stale, and its shadow never matches its form, always stretching into the shape of a cage.
- **Disposition:** A tormentor that controls before it kills, the fiend delights in reshaping battlefields into prisons. It pins enemies with rattling chains, cuts groups apart with lattices of iron, and forces cruel decisions: free an ally and take the lash, or leave them and be dragged away. When pressed, it becomes a cyclone of whirling links, constricting terrain until the battlefield is its personal gallows.

**Abilities**
- **Hooked Chains.** Melee Attack: +20 to hit, reach 15 ft. On a hit, the target takes 6d12+12 slashing damage and is _Grappled_ (escape DC 26). While grappled, the target is also _Restrained_. The fiend can grapple up to 3 creatures at once.
- **Animate Chains (Recharge 5–6).** Up to four unattended chains within 60 ft animate under the fiend’s will. Each chain can make one grapple attempt (same as Hooked Chains, DC 26) at the start of its turn for 1 minute. Animated chains can also form barriers, creating 10 ft long, 10 ft tall lattices of iron that act as walls (AC 20, HP 80).
- **Pain Mirror (Reaction).** When damaged by a creature within 20 ft, the fiend may force the attacker to succeed on a DC 24 WIS save or take 4d10 psychic damage, equal to the pain it attempts to reflect.
- **Iron Cyclone (Recharge 6).** The fiend whirls its chains into a storm, striking all creatures within 20 ft. Each creature must succeed on a DC 25 DEX save or take 8d12 slashing damage and be pulled 15 ft closer to the fiend. On success, creatures take half damage and are not pulled.
