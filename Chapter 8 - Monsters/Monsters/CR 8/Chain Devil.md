Appearance: A gaoler wrapped in living iron—chains threaded through pale skin, hooks clicking like teeth with every gesture. Faces are stamped into links and padlocks: some weep molten rust, others laugh without sound. Its presence smells of cold iron and old incense; its shadow always looks like a cage.  
Disposition: Control before cruelty. It turns terrain into prison—bolting chains into pillars, snaring corridors, and separating allies behind lattices of rattling metal. It delights in forcing choices: free the bound comrade and eat a lash, or leave them and be dragged away in their place. When pressed, it becomes a cyclone of links, harrying from reach while the battlefield shrinks to a choke it alone can pass.

Abilities:  
Hooked Chains: Melee Attack +8 to hit (reach 10 ft), 3d10+4 slashing; on hit, the target is Grappled (escape DC 16).  
Animate Chains (Recharge 5–6): Up to two unattended chains (within 30 ft) become hazards: each can attempt a grapple (as above) once/round for 1 minute.  
Pain Mirror: As a reaction to being damaged by a creature within 10 ft, the devil forces a DC 16 WIS save; on a failure, the attacker takes 1d8 psychic.
