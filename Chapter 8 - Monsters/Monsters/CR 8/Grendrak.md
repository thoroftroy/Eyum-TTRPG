- **Appearance:** The Grendrak is a volcanic juggernaut, its stone-plated hide veined with glowing magma fissures. Massive tusks burn faintly with molten light, dripping slag from their edges. Its hunched, heat-cracked back radiates oppressive warmth, while its colossal forelimbs gouge trenches into the ground with every step. When it exhales, steam and molten spittle hiss from its maw, the earth shuddering beneath its tread.
- **Disposition:** Territorial brutes born of volcanic rifts, Grendraks demolish anything in their path. They charge at intruders with devastating fury, using their immense strength to collapse terrain and trap prey. Despite their savage form, they possess remarkable spatial awareness, never striking the same obstacle twice. They are forces of living geology, breaking mountains as easily as bones.

**Abilities**
- **Seismic Gore.** Melee Attack: +22 to hit, 6d12+17 piercing damage. If the target is on the ground, it must succeed on a DC 26 STR save or be knocked prone.
- **Volcanic Hide (Passive).** Any creature that hits the Grendrak with a melee attack takes 3d10 fire damage unless resistant or immune.
- **Fault Slam (Recharge 5â€“6).** The Grendrak slams the ground, creating a shockwave in a 30 ft radius. All grounded creatures must succeed on a DC 25 DEX save or take 8d12 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. On success, creatures take half damage and remain standing.
- **Lava Charge.** If the Grendrak moves at least 20 ft straight toward a creature and hits with Seismic Gore, the target takes an extra 4d12 fire damage, and the ground within 10 ft of the impact becomes molten, acting as difficult terrain until cooled.
- **Unstoppable Force (Reaction).** When subject to an effect that would reduce its movement, the Grendrak may instead ignore the effect and move its full speed.
