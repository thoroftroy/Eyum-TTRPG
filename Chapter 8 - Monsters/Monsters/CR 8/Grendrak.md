Appearance: A towering brute with plated stone-like hide and tusks that glow faintly with magma veins, the Grendrak resembles a cross between a rhino and a rock elemental. Its back is hunched and cracked with heat, and its mouth drips molten spittle. Its forelimbs are massive, built for impact, and leave gouges in the terrain with each step.
Disposition: Grendraks are territorial juggernauts born in volcanic faultlines. They charge anything that moves too close, treating even mountainsides as obstacles to demolish. Despite their brute appearance, they possess a deep spatial memory, never hitting the same obstacle twice, and often using collapsing terrain to trap prey.
