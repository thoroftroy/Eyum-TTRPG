- **Appearance:** The Arch Demon is cloaked in writhing fire, its obsidian-black hide split by molten veins that pulse like a forge’s heartbeat. Jagged bone armor grows naturally from its frame, charred and seared, fused into its flesh. Its horned face is a permanent mask of contempt, sneering even as the air warps with its heat. Every step scorches the ground, filling the air with ash and the stink of burning iron. Its sword is no simple weapon but a shard of hell itself, wreathed in black flame that screams when it strikes.
- **Disposition:** Arch Demons are apex shock troops of the lower hells, destruction incarnate given form. They live only to burn, crush, and unmake, charging into battle with relentless fury. Their presence alone twists the battlefield into an inferno, choking lungs and searing flesh. Unlike greater demon lords, they are not planners—they are executioners, reveling in slaughter until nothing remains. When wounded, their rage only grows hotter, their firestorms more violent, until divine light itself burns them into silence.
