- **Appearance:** Ice-bright scales with glacier-blue eyes and breath that fogs into needle crystals. The wings are ragged with frost tears; claws click like icicles snapping. Its hoard is a museum of frozen moments—prey statues locked in crystal clear ice.
- **Disposition:** Apex scavenger and territorial brute. It dives from white sky to separate one victim from the herd, drags them into snow blind, then circles for the next. It loves to collapse cornices and bait avalanches, letting the mountain kill for it. Wounded, it burrows into blue ice and stalks via tunnels only it knows.
