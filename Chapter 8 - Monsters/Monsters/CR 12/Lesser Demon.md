Appearance: This lesser demon stands cloaked in living flame, its obsidian hide split by glowing veins of magma that pulse with each heartbeat. Tall and muscular, it moves with a predatorâ€™s grace, armored in jagged plates of scorched bone and wielding a blade wreathed in infernal fire. Its horned visage is twisted in a permanent sneer, and its clawed feet leave behind scorched, smoking footprints. Smoke trails from its back as if it were constantly exhaling the ashes of a dying world.
Disposition: Lesser demons of this kind are shock troops of the hells, elite among the expendable. They live for destruction, fueled by unquenchable rage and fire that never cools. Though lacking the true cunning of higher fiends, they are dangerously single-minded, charging into battle with fury and flame, regenerating through carnage unless halted by divine power. Their presence alone turns the battlefield into an inferno, and when they are wounded, their wrath only burns brighter.
