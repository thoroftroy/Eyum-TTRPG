- **Appearance:** A hound-shaped vault door: squat, plated, and bristling with barbed tongue-chains that taste the air like keys. Its mouth opens the wrong way—hinging into a ring of inward teeth—while armored eyelids shutter with a clockwork click. Dust draws toward it as if pulled by breath through a keyhole.
- **Disposition:** Interdictor beast. It fights to deny space, posting itself in a doorway and lashing any who dare step past. It drags runners back to the threshold, pins them with its weight, and stares down the rest until courage folds. If the field opens, it plants spines and becomes the new doorway, rebuilding the choke wherever the party tries to flee.
