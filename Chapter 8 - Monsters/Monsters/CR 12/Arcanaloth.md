Appearance: A jackal-headed scribe-lord in immaculate robes of parchment hues, every fold inscribed with contracts written in inks that crawl when read. Quills hover like lazy comets around its fingers; tiny seals and coils of twine orbit its wrists with the rhythm of a heartbeat. Its eyes are lantern-glass amber—beautiful, bottomless, and tallying. When it smiles, the smell is vellum, lamp oil, and the faint citrus of freshly cracked wax. Footprints are crisp calligraphy strokes that fade as if erased by an unseen clerk.  
Disposition: Duelist of promises and probabilities. It opens with courtesy to bait concessions—one step, one word, one misplaced oath—then uses illusions and teleport steps to make distance the party’s enemy. It deletes actions with counter-magic, isolates leaders with binding light, and punishes anyone who relies on predictable routines. If cornered, it buys time with words while the battlefield reshapes—contracts turning walls to doors and doors to debts.
