- **Appearance:** The Arcanaloth is a jackal-headed fiend draped in robes of living parchment, every fold etched with shifting contracts and clauses that squirm when read. Hovering quills drip ink into sigils orbiting its wrists, while seals and strings weave around it like a scribe’s halo. Its eyes burn lantern-amber, tallying every movement as though recording debts in real time. When it smiles, the scent of vellum and wax fills the air, and its footprints spell words in forgotten tongues before vanishing like erased script.
- **Disposition:** Arcanaloths are duelists of law and probability, weaving battlefields into ledgers of inevitability. They open with courtesy, buying missteps in conversation before punishing every breach of order. They delight in deleting actions with counter-magic, binding leaders in glyphs of obligation, and fracturing formations with illusions that rewrite the ground itself. When cornered, they stall with rhetoric, stalling long enough for reality itself to become contractually hostile to their enemies.

**Abilities**

- **Contract Seal (Recharge 5–6).** One creature within 120 ft that can see/hear the Arcanaloth must succeed on a DC 52 WIS save or become Restrained by glowing script. At the start of its next turn, if still Restrained, the victim also suffers 8d20 psychic damage. The target may repeat the save at the end of each of its turns.
- **Word of Binding (Reaction).** When a creature within 60 ft casts a spell, the Arcanaloth can force a DC 50 INT save; on failure, the spell fizzles and is lost.

- **Spellcasting (Arcane).** The Arcanaloth prepares battlefield control, illusion, and counter-magic suited to its INT and affinities. Example powers include disjunction fields, mirrored terrain, compelled geas, dimensional severance, and rewritten initiative order (GM adjudication).
