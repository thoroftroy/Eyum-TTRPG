Disposition: Battlefield spoiler. It wants your angles, not your blood—fog the archers, split the melee, draw the healer into a trap. It rotates through control first (gas, reach, shove), then damage only when the field is its own. If outnumbered, it fades into its own smoke and reappears at the softest seam.
