- **Appearance:** Insectile mercenary lacquered in tar and ash, with a visor-plate that splits to reveal a spray of mandibles. Vents in its carapace puff choking grit when it exerts itself; sigil-stamps of former employers dot its shell like travel visas.
- **Disposition:** Battlefield spoiler. It wants your angles, not your blood—fog the archers, split the melee, draw the healer into a trap. It rotates through control first (gas, reach, shove), then damage only when the field is its own. If outnumbered, it fades into its own smoke and reappears at the softest seam.
