Appearance: A winged jackal-ogre of obsidian hide and bronze talons, scarred by a campaign’s worth of sigil-brands. Its wings are leather banners pocked with old sling-stones; its eyes shine like polished garnet cabochons that never blink. A scent of hot pitch and old parchment clings to it, and whenever it lands, dust in a wide radius settles as if saluting a general.  
Disposition: Surgical raider. It opens with a teleporting drop-cut to break formation, then alternates altitude and angles so that rescue lines cross and snarl. It prioritizes leaders and casters, crushing one flank into silence while its aura of intimidation does the rest. If pinned, it exits vertically, resets, and returns at a different vector with the same cold patience.
