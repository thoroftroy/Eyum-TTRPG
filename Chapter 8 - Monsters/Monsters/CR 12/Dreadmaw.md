- **Appearance:** The Dreadmaw is a hulking brute of sinew and bone, its skin stretched taut over muscle clusters that ripple with barely contained violence. Thick black spines jut from its back and forearms, while its claws resemble oversized butcher's blades, constantly dripping with acidic ichor. Its jaw unhinges to reveal rows of mismatched teeth, some jagged and yellowed, others polished and serrated like tools. When it roars, the air itself vibrates with a primal fear, and weaker creatures have been known to collapse under the weight of the sound alone.
- **Disposition:** Dreadmaws exist for destruction, bred or spawned in places where terror itself clings to the ground like mist. They are not predators for sustenance, but avatars of agony and disruption, drawn to battlefields, cursed hunting grounds, and the edge of civilization. Though not intelligent, they possess a brutal cunning, using terrain and overwhelming power to isolate and rip apart their prey. Pain only fuels their rage, and death is often a lie, they rise again through sheer refusal to fall. Only mental assault or psychic unraveling can pierce the instinct-driven engine that powers their fury.
