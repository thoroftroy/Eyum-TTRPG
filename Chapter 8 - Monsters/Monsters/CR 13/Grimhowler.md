- **Appearance:** The Grimhowler is a towering beast of sinew, fur, and exposed muscle, with elongated limbs and a hunched back lined with bone-like spines. Its jaws stretch far beyond natural limits, filled with rows of jagged, regenerating teeth that drip with thick crimson foam. Glowing red runes pulse beneath its skin, reacting violently to pain and hunger, while its eyes burn with primal rage and animal cunning. Each breath it takes is a guttural growl, and each roar echoes like a war cry from some forgotten pit.
- **Disposition:** Grimhowlers are engines of consumption, beasts created not merely to kill, but to rend, feast, and endure. They revel in violence, growing stronger the more blood they spill and entering berserk frenzies as they near death. While not intelligent in the conventional sense, they are masterful predators, capable of ambush, intimidation, and pack-leading behavior. Once locked in battle, they do not retreat, and wounds only deepen their frenzy. Their only true vulnerability is the mind, psychic force severs the primal instinct that drives them, leaving only twitching muscle and cooling rage.
