Appearance: Volkranox is a towering construct of jagged obsidian plates fused together by molten seams that glow like cracks in a volcano. Each of its movements causes tremors, and its heavy frame emits a low, grinding hum, like tectonic plates shifting beneath the earth. Lava pulses visibly beneath its armor, and its fists are massive anvils of blackstone capable of pulverizing steel with a single blow. Despite its bulk, it moves with slow, unstoppable purpose, like a mountain deciding to walk.
Disposition: Volkranox exists to dominate and destroy, forged in the crucibles of the elemental deep to serve as executioner and siege engine. It obeys only the will of the forge-masters or primordial commands embedded in its soul-core, relentlessly pursuing its objectives regardless of resistance. It is impervious to most forms of control or interference, shrugging off attempts to restrain or outmaneuver it. When provoked, it erupts with bursts of internal magma, immolating everything nearby in a tide of fire and fury. Only deep cold and thunderous disruption can fracture its volcanic form.
