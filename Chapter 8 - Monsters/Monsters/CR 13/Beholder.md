Disposition: Paranoid battlefield architect. It claims vertical space, hovering behind cover as if the room itself is its armor. It splits the party with terrain manipulation, turns off magic where it benefits, and pelts priority targets with rays in cruel sequences (slow → fear → disintegrate). It retreats through pre-planned kill corridors, collapsing passages to punish pursuit.
