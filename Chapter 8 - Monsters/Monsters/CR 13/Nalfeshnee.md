Appearance: A corpulent boar-ape with greasy wings too small for its bulk, jewelry made from teeth, and a crown of bone jutting from a bald scalp. Its laughter sounds like a slaughterhouse drain.  
Disposition: Judge of despair. It revels in breaking morale—mocking, taunting, and devouring panic before flesh. In battle it wades into the squishiest cluster, body-checks foes with its gut, and explodes in radiant-corrupt light to scatter the faithful. If its prey steadies, it retreats to the air to rain contempt until the center snaps.
