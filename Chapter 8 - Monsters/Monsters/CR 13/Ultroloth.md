- **Appearance:** Skin the color of stormglass; eyes like polished opals that reflect not the room but your intent. An austere mantle of shadow clings to its shoulders as if it were a court uniform. Its voice is a whispered verdict delivered inches from your ear no matter where it stands. The air around it carries a faint vibration, as if reality were tuned to a single note and the ultroloth is the pitch pipe.
- **Disposition:** General of misdirection. It thinks in vectors and morale, not wounds: blind the archer’s confidence, bend the healer’s attention, **own** the first mistake and compound it. It begins by imposing silence or glamours to erase lines of communication, then strikes surgically with a beam that erases certainty from one target at a time. It never commits without an exit; it treats every wall as a mirror to step through later.
