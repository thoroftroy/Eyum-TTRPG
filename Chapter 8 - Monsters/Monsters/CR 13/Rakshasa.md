Appearance: Tiger-headed aristocrat in silks and jewels, with hands reversed at the wrist—palms outward when arms hang at rest. The voice is honey poured over a blade; the scent is cardamom, ink, and faint brimstone.  
Disposition: Duel-by-conversation first, body second. It tries to name true desires, then offers bargains that turn allies against each other. On the field it hides behind illusions, cuts at the will of the weakest with fear and suggestion, and strikes only when victory is scripted. If cornered, it flees through servants’ hearts and returns where love is a leash.
