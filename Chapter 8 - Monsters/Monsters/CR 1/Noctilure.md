- **Appearance:** The Noctilure is a spectral moth-like creature with four gossamer wings that ripple with a soft, bluish glow, casting shifting crescent patterns like moonlight on water. Each wing is nearly transparent, yet dusted with luminous spores that drift in its wake as it glides silently through the night air. Its slender body pulses faintly with arcane energy, and its antennae seem to twitch toward sources of emotion rather than sound. When still, it appears almost painted from mist and silverleaf, disappearing entirely against the sky when it wishes to vanish.
- **Disposition:** Noctilures are not aggressive but deeply unsettling, drawn to strong emotional currents and sources of magical residue. They congregate in forgotten glades, fae-warped ruins, or quiet battlefield sites where sorrow still lingers. Though largely harmless alone, their disorienting presence and venomous dust make them dangerous in swarms or if provoked. Travelers who camp under a full moon may awaken to one hovering nearby, its glow silently pulsing in rhythm with their dreams—or nightmares.
