Appearance: The Sloughgrim is a lurching mass of living mud and decayed flesh, its form barely held together by strands of sinew and elemental sludge. Bones jut from its back and chest at odd angles, slick with grime, while its face is a half-dissolved skull masked by wet clay. It gurgles as it moves, leaving behind puddles that bubble with trapped air and rot. Its arms stretch unnaturally when striking, dripping globs of sludge that hiss when they touch dry ground.
Disposition: Sloughgrims are the drowned dead, raised by twisted magic where elemental forces and cursed decay meet, swamps, blighted rivers, and sunken crypts. They are slow and mindless, but drawn to motion and warmth, often rising from mire with little warning to drag intruders under. Their instincts are purely destructive: smother, trap, and choke. While easily outpaced on open land, in wet terrain they become deadly, able to slow and drown prey in moments. Fires drive them into thrashing panic, and many dissolve entirely if burned thoroughly.
