Appearance: A mangy, drake-headed bird with shale-colored feathers and a rubbery crest, like a barnyard mistake given spite and wings. The beak drips chalky saliva that hardens into flakes on the ground.  
Disposition: Nasty scavenger that dive-harasses larger creatures, then retreats to ledges and rafters. It goes for isolated targets and pecks relentlessly until something stops moving—or looks at it wrong.
