- **Appearance:** The Sootfang is a charcoal-colored beast with sleek, scorched fur that gives off a subtle plume of smoke wherever it walks. Its eyes glow with emberlight, two seething coals set deep into a lean, lupine skull. When it exhales, wisps of black smoke rise from its nostrils and the gaps between its bared, fire-licked teeth. A faint smell of burnt wood lingers in its wake, and its pawprints occasionally scorch the ground, especially in dry brush or forest undergrowth.
- **Disposition:** Sootfangs are relentless hunters bred from flame and shadow. While not particularly cunning, they are fiercely territorial and will chase down intruders with unyielding speed and primal aggression. They favor ambushes cloaked in smoke, using their innate ability to obscure vision before striking. These creatures are most often found patrolling volcanic ridges, scorched forests, or ancient battlegrounds still smoldering with magical ruin. Their loyalty, once earned, is unshakable; some warlocks and druids have even managed to tame them as pets.
