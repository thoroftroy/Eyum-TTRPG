- **Appearance:** The medusa’s marble-pale skin is veined with faint green, her head a writhing crown of serpents that hiss and coil with predatory malice. Her jade eyes shimmer with cruel intelligence, reflecting victims as statues already frozen in terror. Each movement is graceful, her beauty twisted into a weapon of fear and control.
- **Disposition:** A cruel duelist who values control over brute force. Medusas open with their petrifying gaze to disable the boldest foes, then strike from range with deadly precision. Calculating and ruthless, they retreat the instant their advantage falters, only to return with traps and reinforcements.
