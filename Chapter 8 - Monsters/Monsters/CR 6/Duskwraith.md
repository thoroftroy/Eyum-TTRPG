- **Appearance:** The Duskwraith looms as a towering figure of shadow and smoke, wrapped in drifting tatters of robes that swirl as though caught in unseen winds. Its form flickers at the edges, never fully solid, as if half-banished from existence. From its darkness sometimes emerges a pale, eyeless face twisted by sorrow and wrath, only to vanish again into the gloom. Wherever it moves, the air grows colder, and light itself dims, as though dusk descends in its wake.
- **Disposition:** Born from souls that perished violently at twilight, Duskwraiths wander ruins, cursed keeps, and shadowed battlefields. Patient and cunning, they prefer to sow fear and despair before striking. Their whispers gnaw at sanity, stealing hope before life itself. Their touch drains not just flesh but willpower, leaving victims hollow-eyed and despairing. Only the brightest light or holy radiance can banish them fully.
