Appearance: The Duskwraith is a towering, spectral figure cloaked in layers of shifting shadow and tattered robes that drift like smoke in still air. Its form is barely corporeal, often flickering at the edges as though caught between worlds. A pale, ghastly face occasionally emerges from the gloom, eyeless, sunken, and twisted with ancient grief or rage. When it moves, it leaves no sound but a deepening chill and a subtle dimming of nearby light, as if dusk itself gathers around it.
Disposition: Duskwraiths are remnants of souls who met violent ends during twilight hours, caught between day and night, life and death. Intelligent and hauntingly patient, they drift through ruined halls, cursed battlefields, or forsaken keeps, whispering unspeakable truths into the minds of the living. They avoid direct confrontation when possible, preferring fear, despair, and weakening over brute force. Their draining touch steals not just life, but the will to resist, and many of their victims fall not in combat, but in surrender to hopelessness. Only the brightest light or purest radiance can banish them entirely.
