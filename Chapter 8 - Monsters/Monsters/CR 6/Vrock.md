Appearance: A carrion vulture grown into a knightmare—mangy wings, rusted iron talons, and a beak chipped like a broken idol. Feathers shed a gray dandruff that smells like mausoleum air. Its shriek is a laugh sharpened into a blade.  
Disposition: Distraction and despair. The vrock opens with a screeching dive to scatter formation, then fixes on a solitary foe to rake and fling. It delights in fouling air with spores while it hovers just out of reach, daring archers to waste arrows through the miasma. If bloodied, it peels off into thermals and returns when the field is noisy again.
