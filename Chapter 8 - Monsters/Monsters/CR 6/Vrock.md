- **Appearance:** A carrion vulture twisted into nightmare form—its mangy wings beat with sickly strength, its rusted iron talons gleam with rot, and its chipped beak resembles a broken idol. Its feathers constantly shed a gray, corpse-scented dust, filling the air with the smell of mausoleums. Its shriek is a serrated laugh, a sound sharpened into pain.
- **Disposition:** Agents of distraction and despair, vrocks strike with piercing shrieks and scattering dives, rending prey apart with brutal talons before tossing bodies aside. They revel in fouling the battlefield with their choking spore-clouds, hovering above like executioners daring archers to waste their shots. Cowardly yet cruel, they retreat if bloodied, only to circle back when chaos reignites.
