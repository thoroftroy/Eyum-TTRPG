- **Appearance:** The Virelith is a hauntingly beautiful winged fey with feathers the color of dried blood, thorny ridges along her wings and spine, and glassy obsidian eyes that reflect the world like black mirrors. Her talons shine like silvered blades, and her melodic, resonant voice shifts between alluring song and maddening shriek. Each wingbeat leaves a glittering trail of shimmer dust, filled with faint whispers—echoes of minds she has stolen. When she bares her serrated teeth, her beauty twists into cruelty.
- **Disposition:** Cruel and cunning, Vireliths thrive on manipulation and sadistic delight, cloaking torment in enchantment. They lure travelers with song, fracture wills with whispers, and revel in the pain of those ensnared by their illusions. Alien in morality, they obsess over domination of mind and spirit, treating mortals as toys. Only thunder shatters their control, breaking their voice and illusions, enraging them into reckless violence.
