Appearance: The Virelith is a wickedly beautiful winged fey with feathers the color of dried blood and thorns growing along the ridges of her wings and spine. Her eyes are glassy black, reflecting light like obsidian, and her talons glint like silvered blades. Her voice carries a haunting resonance, both melodic and maddening, and her mouth is lined with fine, serrated teeth that belie her enchanting form. Each beat of her wings leaves a trail of shimmer dust and faint whispers, some say echoes of minds she's stolen.
Disposition: Vireliths are cruel and cunning, reveling in manipulation, misdirection, and pain disguised as beauty. They haunt windswept crags, ancient ruins, and twilight groves twisted by fey spite, often luring wanderers with their alluring songs before tearing them apart with savage glee. Though not evil in the mortal sense, their morality is alien and predatory, captivated by suffering and obsessed with domination of will. Only thunder breaks their hold, disrupting their voice and scattering their illusions in a shriek of rage.
