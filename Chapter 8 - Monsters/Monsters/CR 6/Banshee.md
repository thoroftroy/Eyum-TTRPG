- **Size:** Medium
- **Appearance:** A tangle of pale, spectral hair and a shredded gown floats around a corpse-pale figure whose face twists between silent agony and piercing rage. Its form drifts like smoke, weightless and sorrowful, until the silence breaks into a soul-rending scream that shakes both flesh and spirit. The banshee’s presence chills the marrow, and its eyes burn with the hatred of centuries-long grief.
- **Disposition:** Banshees haunt ancient ruins, forgotten halls, and cursed battlefields. They lure intruders with distant sobs and whispers, feeding on dread before striking. When prey gathers, they unleash a deathly wail that topples the strong and shatters resolve. More than killers, banshees are curses made flesh, holding grudges against any who dare live where they linger.
