- **Appearance:** A storm of wind shaped like a humanoid outline, its edges fraying into spirals of dust, leaves, and lightning sparks. Its “face” is an absence, a shifting void that howls when it speaks. The Zephyrix’s body flickers as if phasing between gusts, its limbs scattering into gales when struck.
- **Disposition:** Zephyrixes are trickster-tempests, neither wholly cruel nor kind. They scatter armies with cyclones, strip the roofs from fortresses, and vanish laughing on the stormfront. They respect speed above all things and will pursue fleeing prey for days.
