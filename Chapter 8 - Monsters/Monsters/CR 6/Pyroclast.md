Appearance: The Pyroclast is a towering elemental juggernaut formed of blackened stone, jagged obsidian, and rivers of molten lava that pulse like veins beneath its cracked armor. Its massive limbs glow from within, emitting waves of shimmering heat, and its core blazes with a furnace-like intensity. Each step sends tremors through the ground, leaving scorched footprints and trails of molten residue. When it moves, its body clanks and groans like breaking earth, and its breath vents superheated steam from vents along its shoulders and back.
Disposition: Pyroclasts are ancient engines of destruction, bound to volcanic temples, fire-forged vaults, or the shattered remains of fallen empires. Though unintelligent, they are driven by elemental instinct to defend their domain, destroy interlopers, and maintain the eternal flame that sustains them. They strike with overwhelming force, shattering stone and incinerating flesh in equal measure. Their very presence warps the environment, turning air dry and brittle, and setting fire to wooden structures or dry brush within minutes. Only water or overwhelming cold can slow their advance, though quenching a Pyroclast rarely ends without collateral ruin.
