- **Appearance:** The Pyroclast towers as a living engine of volcanic ruin, its body forged from jagged obsidian and slabs of blackened stone, shot through with veins of molten lava that pulse like arteries of fire. Each movement groans like the cracking of mountains, while its furnace-like core blazes so brightly it silhouettes itself through its own body. Every step shakes the ground, leaving behind scorched craters that glow faintly for hours. Steam vents hiss and roar from its shoulders and back, casting plumes of searing mist that burn the lungs of those nearby.
- **Disposition:** Pyroclasts are ancient guardians bound to volcanic temples, ruined cities, and elemental vaults. Unthinking but relentless, they defend their territory with cataclysmic force, crushing stone and immolating flesh. Their presence reshapes the battlefield, desiccating wood, igniting brush, and reducing air to brittle heat. Quenching one with water or frost is possible—but the devastation that follows is inevitable.
