- **Appearance:** A squat, moss-cloaked boulder with ridged knuckles that flex like stone fingers and pebble-like eyes hidden beneath lichen lashes. Veins of quartz glow faintly when it rumbles, and spores puff from its lichens like sighs. When motionless, it is indistinguishable from common rock, but when disturbed, it rises with the weight of mountains and the patience of ages.
- **Disposition:** A living siege engine with a gardener’s patience. The Galeb Duhr defends ancient places of stone, rising only when trespassers threaten. It prefers to repel intruders rather than destroy them, rolling wagons onto their sides, pinning rather than shattering, and using its strength to preserve ancient works of earth. To face one in its home is to fight the will of the land itself.
