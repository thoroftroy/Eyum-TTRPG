Appearance: A squat boulder with knuckled ridges that flex like fingers and pebble eyes buried under moss lashes. Lichens puff spoor when it rumbles; veins of quartz glitter like slow thoughts.  
Disposition: Siege engine with a gardener’s patience. It becomes a rock until trespass breaks the peace, then rises to become a wall where the path narrows. It hates waste: it will throw invaders back rather than crush them, roll to pin wagons instead of shatter them, and fight to keep ancient stones unbroken.
