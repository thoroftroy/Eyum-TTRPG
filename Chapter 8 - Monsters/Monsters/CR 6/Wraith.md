- **Size:** Medium
- **Appearance:** A hooded void from which no face can be seen, surrounded by wind that draws inexorably toward it. Lantern light bends and falters nearby, swallowed into its emptiness. Its form ripples like torn fabric of shadow, and its passing chills the soul as much as the flesh. The faint hiss of unseen whispers trails its every movement.
- **Disposition:** A battlefield reaper that cleaves through the heart of conflict, sowing dread and despair. Wraiths do not fight for survival—they fight for inevitability. They retreat only to lure prey into deeper darkness, where hope vanishes and death follows.
