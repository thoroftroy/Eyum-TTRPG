- **Appearance:** The Gravethorn is a towering, heavily armored juggernaut clad in thick iron plates, many of which are welded directly into its flesh or fused with ancient bone. Its face is hidden behind a dented visor, and steam hisses from vents in its pauldrons as it moves. Its body bears the scars of countless battles—scratched sigils, rusted chain-links, and broken weapons embedded in its frame. Despite its brutal bulk, it moves with frightening momentum, like a war machine barely restrained by flesh.
- **Disposition:** Gravethorns are bred, or forged, for war, often found serving as enforcers, warlords, or living battering rams in siege cults and martial clans. They care little for tactics beyond forward assault, and their fury is directed with singular focus toward whatever stands in their path. Once engaged, they rely on sheer force and unbreakable stamina to overwhelm foes, shrugging off blows that would fell lesser warriors. Lightning is their bane, arcing between their armor plates and overloading their dense bodies with spasms of burning energy. Outside of battle, they are quiet, brooding creatures who understand strength more than speech.
