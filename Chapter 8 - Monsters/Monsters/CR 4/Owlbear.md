- **Appearance:** A feather-matted ursine titan with a hooked beak and burning, murder-bright eyes. Its heavy frame ripples with muscle under ragged patches of feathers, and its guttural screeches echo like a hunting owl magnified to monstrous volume. When enraged, its fur and plumage bristle, and its charge shakes the ground like a battering ram of flesh and talons.
- **Disposition:** Territorial mauler that charges into battle without hesitation. It grapples and shreds its prey with terrifying strength, fighting until either it or its opponent lies broken. Owlbears are feared not just for their brutality, but for their persistence—once they set their sights on a target, they do not relent.
