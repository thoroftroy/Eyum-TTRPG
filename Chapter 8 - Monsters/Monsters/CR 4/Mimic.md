- **Appearance:** Gluey, toothed “furniture” dripping adhesive ichor.

Its ichor smells faintly of iron and rot, clinging to everything it touches.    
- **Disposition:** Ambush predator that lies perfectly still for hours or days until prey draws close. When it strikes, it glues victims in place and bites them repeatedly, relishing the panic of trapped prey.
