- **Appearance:** The Vintershade is a spectral warrior encased in brittle frost and burial rags, with armor glazed in centuries-old ice. Its skin is pale blue-gray, stretched thin over frozen muscle, and its eyes glow like dying coals trapped beneath a glacier. Frost clings to its blade and limbs, cracking with each motion, and a bitter cold follows in its wake, coating the ground in thin rime. When it moves, it does so with silent, relentless purpose, as though time itself has frozen around it.
- **Disposition:** Vintershades are born of betrayal and permafrost, cursed souls who died in vengeance and rose when their wrath outlasted death. They patrol icy tombs, abandoned keeps, and wind-scoured battlefields, hunting those who resemble their killers or disturb their resting places. Though mute, their presence radiates mourning and malice. In freezing environments, they are nearly unkillable, their forms stitching back together with every icy gust. Only fire or radiant power can burn through their sorrowful endurance.
