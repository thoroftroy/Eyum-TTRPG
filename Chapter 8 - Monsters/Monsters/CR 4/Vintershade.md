Appearance: The Vintershade is a spectral warrior encased in brittle frost and burial rags, with armor glazed in centuries-old ice. Its skin is a pale blue-gray stretched thin over frozen muscle, and its eyes glow like dying coals trapped under a glacier. Frost clings to its blade and limbs, cracking with each motion, and a bitter cold follows in its wake, coating the ground with thin layers of rime. When it moves, it does so with silent, relentless purpose.
Disposition: Vintershades are born of betrayal and permafrost, cursed souls who died in vengeance and rose when their wrath outlasted death. They patrol icy tombs, abandoned keeps, and wind-scoured battlefields, hunting those who resemble their killers or disturb their resting places. Though they cannot speak, their presence conveys mourning and malice in equal measure. In freezing environments, they are almost unkillable, regenerating with each gust of winter wind. Fire is one of the few forces that can disrupt their grim persistence, and radiant magic burns through their sorrowful form like sunlight through hoarfrost.
