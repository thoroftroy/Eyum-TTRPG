Appearance: Grizzly bears are enormous, powerfully built quadrupeds covered in thick, coarse fur that ranges from deep brown to grayish silver. Their shoulders hunch higher than their hips, supported by massive forelimbs ending in black, hooked claws nearly a foot long. Their heads are broad and flat with small round ears and a heavy snout capable of crushing bone. Scarred hides and embedded quills or thorns are common signs of surviving many wilderness encounters.
Disposition: Naturally solitary, grizzlies are territorial and easily provoked. They will typically ignore passing travelers unless approached too closely, threatened, or surprised. A mother bear becomes extremely aggressive when guarding cubs and will charge without hesitation. Though not evil, grizzlies are ruled by instinct and do not retreat unless critically injured or outnumbered.
