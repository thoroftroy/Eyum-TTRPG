- **Appearance:** The Cinderwisp is a bat-like creature forged from ember and smoke, its leathery wings laced with glowing cracks like cooled magma. When in flight, its body leaves behind a faint trail of drifting ash, and its claws burn faintly orange even in total darkness. Its eyes are pinpricks of fire, and its fur appears charred, constantly shedding flecks of soot. Despite its volatile form, the Cinderwisp is eerily graceful, gliding on thermals with whisper-quiet wings that flare brilliantly when it attacks.
- **Disposition:** Cinderwisps are born from firestorms, volcanic vents, or failed summoning rituals, and they act as swift, skittish predators of the high skies and scorched lands. While not overtly aggressive, they are territorial and prone to dive-bombing threats with streaks of flame before vanishing into the smoke. Their favorite tactic is to lure foes into dry terrain, then ignite the ground in a fiery cyclone upon landing. Travelers in volcanic regions often mistake their glow for harmless sparks, until the night sky erupts with winged flame.
