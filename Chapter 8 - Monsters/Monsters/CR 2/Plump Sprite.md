- **Appearance:** Plump Sprites are round-bellied, winged fey with pudgy limbs and shimmering, insectile wings that buzz with surprising strength despite their bulk. Their skin is soft and rosy, often dusted with crumbs or sticky with honey, and their clothes are little more than patchwork tunics stretched too tightly across their frames. Their faces are cherubic but perpetually scowling, with flushed cheeks and sharp little eyes that dart between food, mischief, and imagined slights. A faint smell of sugar and mead follows them wherever they go.
- **Disposition:** Lazy and gluttonous, Plump Sprites prefer lounging in sunbeams or drifting idly between branches while nibbling stolen pastries. They are mischievous to a fault, pranking travelers with sticky traps, buzzing taunts, or food thefts. Despite their comical appearance, they are quick to anger when mocked or denied food, and their tantrums can turn dangerous as they lash out with bursts of enchanted sugar-air. They rarely fight to the death, preferring to humiliate foes before buzzing off in a huff.
