- **Appearance:** The Ferrivex is a hulking, lizard-like construct formed of warped metal plates, jagged scrap, and pulsing veins of corroded iron. Its joints creak with oxidized grinding, and its mouth is lined with mismatched, serrated fangs forged from twisted rebar and broken blades. Rust constantly flakes from its body as it moves, leaving reddish smears wherever it treads. Two dull, red-lit eyes glow beneath a brow of cracked plating, and its breath smells of molten iron and decay.
- **Disposition:** Ferrivexes exist only to feed, on steel, iron, brass, or anything resembling metal. They are relentless in their pursuit of machinery, weapons, or armor, often breaking into vaults or siege camps by gnawing through barriers that would stop most beasts. Though not truly intelligent, they exhibit rudimentary tracking behavior and can "smell" metal through walls. Their corrosive bite is feared by adventurers, as even a glancing wound can dissolve gear in moments. Left in forgotten forges or scrapyards, Ferrivexes grow stronger the longer they feast, swelling with warped reinforcements as they consume the ruins around them.
