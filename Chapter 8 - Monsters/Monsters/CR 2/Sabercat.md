Appearance: A sabercat is a lean, muscular feline predator with massive front shoulders, sleek tan or dusky fur, and long curved fangs extending from its upper jaw. Its low-slung movement and slitted golden eyes give it a ghostlike presence in brush and forest.
Disposition: Sabercats are ambush predators that stalk prey silently before lunging with explosive speed. They prefer surprise kills and will flee if the battle turns against them. When cornered, they become frenzied and savage.
