Appearance: A Chitterfang Swarm is a writhing mass of obsidian-shelled insects, each about the size of a coin, with jagged mandibles and twitching antennae. Their bodies gleam like polished stone, but beneath the sheen lies a frantic, seething hunger. The swarm flows over surfaces like a living oil spill, climbing walls, pouring through cracks, and hurling itself at prey with uncanny coordination. When in motion, the air fills with a deafening chorus of clicks, chittering, and the dry rasp of clawed limbs skittering over stone and wood.
Disposition: Though mindless in the traditional sense, the Chitterfang Swarm behaves with disturbing cohesion, driven by a single collective instinct: devour. They react to movement and heat with terrifying speed, overwhelming their target in a tide of slicing mandibles and suffocating weight. Though weak individually, their numbers make them a serious threat in confined spaces or cluttered terrain. Most commonly found in crypts, abandoned mines, and corrupted rootways, these swarms are drawn to rot, blood, and magic left to decay. Fire is their bane, and thunder sends them into frenzied retreat, but only if they havenâ€™t already consumed the source.
