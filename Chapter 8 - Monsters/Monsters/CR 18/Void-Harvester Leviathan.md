Appearance: A pelagic cathedral of cartilage and black glass, its hide veined with cold starlight that crawls beneath translucent skin like constellations learning to breathe. Six gill-arches glow with pale aurora; between them, gravity beads the sea into trembling pearls that fall upward. Barnacles on its flanks have grown into spiraled antennae; each rotates to “listen” to intent as much as sound. Wherever it feeds, light arrives late: torches bend toward its shadow, and bubbles orbit its jaws before surrendering.  
Disposition: Patient orbital hunter. It keeps to the edge of perception—just beyond lantern range or just below the thermocline—probing with invisible tugs that pull formation apart. When a straggler shifts out of step, the Leviathan adjusts the battlefield instead of its path: floors tilt, currents reverse, and cover becomes a river carrying you toward its mouth. It prefers to win by inevitability: choose the weakest focus, magnify their panic with the ocean itself, and let fear write the rest. If seriously hurt, it folds space the width of a heartbeat and reappears behind the loudest mind in the room.
