CR: 18  
AC: 19  
HP: 240 (20d12+100)  
Vitality: 120 (10d12+20)  
Speed: 0 ft, Fly 30 ft (hover)  
Size: Tiny (skull)  
Height/Width: 9–12 in; jeweled teeth & inlaid bone  
Weight: 7–12 lbs  
Appearance: A jewel-encrusted skull that floats on a slow gyre of dust motes and syllables it once spoke. Gemstones sit where teeth and eyes belonged; they drink light rather than reflect it. Lines of runes are etched into the sutures like maps of vanished empires. When it turns, air temperature drops a degree and parchment nearby curls inward. Every corridor it has haunted remembers: candles gutter toward it, tapestries fade, and the color red seems to hesitate before crossing the threshold.  
Disposition: Tyrant of the invisible layers—sound, memory, breath. A demilich is patient to cruelty: it waits until the party’s cadence is steady, then **removes** a beat—silence here, a sleep there—so that teamwork unravels one thread at a time. It rarely moves; it **repositions** the fight instead, by collapsing stairs, stealing voices, or swallowing the room’s air in a single hungry breath. If pressed, it becomes impossible to corner, phasing through arrow-slits and chanting in counterpoint from every doorway at once.  
STR: 1 (−5) | DEX: 20 (+5) | CON: 20 (+5) | INT: 22 (+6) | WIS: 20 (+5) | CHA: 20 (+5)  
Resistances: Magic Resistance (advantage on saving throws vs. spells)  
Weaknesses: Radiant  
Abilities:  
Soul-Draining Wail (Recharge 5–6): Creatures of the demilich’s choice within 30 ft make a DC 20 CON save or take **10d10** necrotic and are Stunned until the end of their next turn (half and no stun on success).  
Grave Pulse: 20-ft aura. Creatures that start their turn in the aura can’t regain HP until the start of their next turn.  
Devour Essence: One creature the demilich can see within 60 ft makes a DC 20 WIS save; on a failure, **8d12** necrotic and the target suffers Disadvantage on its next saving throw.
