- **Type:** Undead
- **CR:** 18
- **AC:** 430
- **HP:** 41,200 (820d12+16,400)
- **Vitality:** 30,200 (820d10+16,400)
- **Speed:** 0 ft, Fly 30 ft (hover)
- **Size:** Tiny (9–12 in, 7–12 lbs)
- **Appearance:** A jewel-encrusted skull that floats on a slow gyre of dust motes and syllables it once spoke. Gemstones sit where teeth and eyes belonged; they drink light rather than reflect it. Lines of runes are etched into the sutures like maps of vanished empires. When it turns, air temperature drops a degree and parchment nearby curls inward. Every corridor it has haunted remembers: candles gutter toward it, tapestries fade, and the color red seems to hesitate before crossing the threshold.
- **Disposition:** Tyrant of the invisible layers—sound, memory, breath. A demilich is patient to cruelty: it waits until the party’s cadence is steady, then **removes** a beat—silence here, a sleep there—so that teamwork unravels one thread at a time. It rarely moves; it **repositions** the fight instead, by collapsing stairs, stealing voices, or swallowing the room’s air in a single hungry breath. If pressed, it becomes impossible to corner, phasing through arrow-slits and chanting in counterpoint from every doorway at once.

**Abilities**
- **Soul-Draining Wail (Recharge 5–6).** Creatures of the demilich’s choice within 30 ft make a DC 75 CON save or take 40d10 necrotic and are Stunned until the end of their next turn (half and no stun on success).
- **Grave Pulse.** 20-ft aura. Creatures that start their turn in the aura can’t regain HP until the start of their next turn.
- **Devour Essence.** One creature the demilich can see within 60 ft makes a DC 75 WIS save; on a failure, 30d12 necrotic and the target suffers Disadvantage on its next saving throw.
- **Phantom Drift (Passive).** The demilich can move through walls, ceilings, and floors as if incorporeal, leaving behind an illusory double at the previous position until the start of its next turn.
