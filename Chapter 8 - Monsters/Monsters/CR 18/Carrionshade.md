- **Appearance:** The Carrionshade is a hulking, rotted figure clad in ceremonial armor overgrown with black fungal blooms and chains of bone. Its flesh is bloated and cracked with greenish-black veins, constantly leaking tendrils of pestilent mist. Glowing glyphs of undeath pulse along its skin like infected runes, and its elongated claws drip with a putrid substance that sizzles against any living matter. When it speaks, its voice is the sound of corpses gasping beneath the soil, rasping, layered, and wrong.
- **Disposition:** Carrionshades are avatars of death without decay, undying tyrants cursed to rule plague-choked lands from cryptic thrones. Intelligent and cruel, they do not seek conquest through might alone, but through the slow erosion of hope, life, and resistance. Their presence rots the ground, fouls the air, and invites blight to anything that lingers too long in their shadow. Even when brought to the brink of death, they rise again, borne on unholy willpower and the whispers of those they’ve buried. Only radiant force, pure and absolute, can sever their hold on the mortal world.
