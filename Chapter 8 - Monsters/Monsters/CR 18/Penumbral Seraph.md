- **Size:** Large (9–11 ft, 300–450 lbs)
- **Appearance:** A figure in vestments of star-smoke and candle-ash, six wings overlapping like eclipse phases. Where feathers molt, darkness flakes away in glints like stilled snow; where it looks, dust aligns as if obeying a quiet hymn. Silver script crawls across its skin, redacting itself as vows change. When the Seraph draws its blade, the edge shows places where light failed—and was forgiven.
- **Disposition:** Shepherd of thresholds. It tries peace first, not to spare foes but to spare witnesses, shaping battles to doorways and bridges where retreat remains possible. When forced to kill, it fights like an editor: removing lies (illusions), cutting noise (buffs), and paring the scene down to a single, clean stroke. If allies falter, it interposes with geometry, moving in straight lines that somehow bend space to be between blade and victim every time.
