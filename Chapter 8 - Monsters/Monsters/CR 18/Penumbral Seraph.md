Appearance: A figure in vestments of star-smoke and candle-ash, six wings overlapping like eclipse phases. Where feathers molt, darkness flakes away in glints like stilled snow; where it looks, dust aligns as if obeying a quiet hymn. Silver script crawls across its skin, redacting itself as vows change. When the Seraph draws its blade, the edge shows places where light failed—and was forgiven.  
Disposition: Shepherd of thresholds. It tries peace first, not to spare foes but to spare witnesses, shaping battles to doorways and bridges where retreat remains possible. When forced to kill, it fights like an editor: removing lies (illusions), cutting noise (buffs), and paring the scene down to a single, clean stroke. If allies falter, it interposes with geometry, moving in straight lines that somehow bend space to be between blade and victim every time.

Abilities:  
Eclipse Blade: Melee Attack +16 to hit, **10d10+7** slashing (radiant on criticals at GM discretion).  
Stasis Halo (Recharge 5–6): 20-ft sphere within 60 ft; creatures of choice must make a DC **22** WIS save or have **Move** reduced to 0 and be unable to take **Reactions** until end of their next turn; success → unaffected.  
Aegis Interposition: As a reaction when a creature within 10 ft would be hit, the Seraph swaps places and becomes the target of the attack.
