- **Appearance:** A walking sanctuary of volcanic glass and brass ribs, panes of obsidian etched with hymns that crawl when no one watches. The “face” is a rose window of smoked crystal; silhouettes pace within—echoes of congregations long ground into ash. Bell-chains hang inside the chest cavity and toll in muffled heartbeats when the construct turns. Where it steps, stone vitrifies to mirrors; where it strikes, mosaics shatter into razors that rearrange themselves into new prayers.
- **Disposition:** Territory as doctrine. The Basilica redraws the arena into naves and transepts: it drops panes to create aisles, pins the rash behind glass, and forces everyone else to fight in its pews. It advances like ritual—step, toll, cut—denying angles until only the center aisle remains, and that’s where its hammer falls. If surrounded, it folds glass into itself and emerges two “chapters” away with the party now standing in a confessional.
