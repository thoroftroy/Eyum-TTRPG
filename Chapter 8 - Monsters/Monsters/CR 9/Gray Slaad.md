Size: Large

Appearance: Slate skin with lightning-white scars etched in fractal glyphs, eyes like wet ash. It moves with feral elegance, knuckles barely touching ground, and tools (rings, knives) hover near its hands as if the air were sticky.  
Disposition: Predator-savant. It studies, mimics, and then unmakes. The gray slaad slips into a party’s rhythm, sabotaging spacing and timing, then rips the beat apart with a sudden flurry. It favors casters and leaders—those who hold patterns together. When resisted, it abandons flourish for brutality and ends the loudest heartbeat in the room.
