- **Speed:** 50 ft

- **Appearance:** The Gray Slaad bears slate-colored skin marred with lightning-white scars that etch themselves into fractal glyphs, glowing faintly as if alive. Its eyes are the color of wet ash, shifting with strange focus, and it moves with unsettling feral elegance, knuckles brushing the ground in deceptive calm. Knives, rings, and bits of metal hover unnaturally near its claws, held aloft as though the air itself is viscous and clings to its will.
- **Disposition:** A predator-savant, the Gray Slaad does not rush battle—it studies. It mimics the rhythm of its prey, slips into their timing, and then tears the beat apart with sudden, brutal precision. It favors spellcasters and leaders, seeking to shatter coordination before moving to finish the loudest heartbeat in the room. Against resistance, it abandons flourish for sheer savagery, rending apart its prey with unstoppable violence.
