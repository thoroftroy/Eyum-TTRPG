Appearance: A mantis-thin skeleton lacquered in ivory, with a scorpion tail that clicks its segments like a prayer wheel. Empty eye sockets hold caged embers; parchment wings creak when spread, shedding powder as if from old books. It speaks with courtroom patience and butcher’s economy.  
Disposition: Surgical terror. The bone devil stalks high value targets, feinting with reach before threading through lines to sting and retreat. It grinds morale by snatching downed foes away from healers, building a pile of “evidence” at its feet. If outmatched, it harrows with drive-by stings and never lands until one victim is isolated beyond retrieval.
