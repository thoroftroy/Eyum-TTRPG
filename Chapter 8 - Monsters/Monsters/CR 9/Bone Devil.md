- **Appearance:** The Bone Devil is a mantis-thin skeleton lacquered in gleaming ivory, its jagged scorpion tail clicking segments like a prayer wheel. Empty eye sockets burn with caged embers, and its parchment-thin wings spread with the creak of old tomes, releasing powdered dust like pages ground to ash. It carries itself with courtroom patience and butcher’s precision, cutting into battle with unnerving restraint and deliberate cruelty.
- **Disposition:** A surgical terror of the battlefield, the Bone Devil stalks high-value targets with methodical patience. It threads through ranks with its elongated claws, feints at range, and strikes with its venomous tail before retreating into the air. Its cruelty lies in grinding morale, snatching fallen prey from healers and piling their corpses like trophies. When pressed, it adopts guerrilla tactics, harrying with fly-by stings until an isolated victim can be dragged to its "court of bones."
