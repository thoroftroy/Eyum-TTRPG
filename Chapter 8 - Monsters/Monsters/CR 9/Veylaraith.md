Appearance: The Veylaraith appears as a lithe, masked figure draped in layers of dusk-hued silk and veil-like tendrils that flow unnaturally even in still air. Its eyes, visible only when it wills, flicker like violet flame beneath an intricately carved obsidian mask. When it moves, its steps leave behind faint echoes and shadowy mirages, and its presence dims both sound and light in a subtle, suffocating way. Its blade is not made of metal, but of focused will and forgotten anguish, glowing with psychic resonance.
Disposition: Veylaraiths serve as wardens of twilight realms and corrupted fae groves where dreams sour into nightmares. They are guardians not of peace, but of silence, punishing those who disturb the balance between illusion and reality. Though rarely openly hostile, they toy with intruders, using clones, whispers, and fear to disorient their prey before striking with precision. Their presence erodes certainty and courage alike, and their victims often fall not from wounds, but from terror that blooms into madness. Fire and thunder are among the few forces that break through their veils of deception.
