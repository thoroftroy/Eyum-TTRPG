- **Size:** Medium (6–7 ft tall, weightless veiled form)
- **Appearance:** The Veylaraith manifests as a lithe, masked figure cloaked in dusk-hued silks and flowing veil-tendrils that drift as though in a phantom wind. Its obsidian mask hides all but the flickering violet flames of its eyes, which glow when it wills them visible. Every step leaves behind lingering echoes and warped mirages, and the air dims around its presence, sound muffled, light smothered. In its hand shimmers a blade woven from anguish and fractured will, glowing faintly with psychic resonance as though reality itself strains against its edge.
- **Disposition:** Veylaraiths are twilight wardens of corrupted fae groves and shadowed dream-realms, guardians not of peace but of silence. They toy with intruders, spawning illusions and whispers to break courage before delivering precise, devastating strikes. Their victims often collapse not from wounds, but from terror and madness, their will eroded until resistance dies. Fire and thunder unravel their veils, tearing through illusions and breaking their dominion over shadow and silence.
