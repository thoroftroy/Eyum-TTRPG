Appearance: The Velmourn is a spectral assassin clad in flowing crimson-black garments that shimmer like dried blood under moonlight. Its body is thin and angular, with bones sharp beneath semi-corporeal flesh, and its hands wield cruel, rune-etched daggers that seem to drink in surrounding light. A tattered hood obscures most of its face, revealing only glowing red eyes and a grim, eternal grin etched into its gaunt cheeks. Every movement is fluid, deliberate, and silent, like a shadow given sentience and hatred.
Disposition: Velmourns are born from the union of powerful curses and violent death, souls who refused to fade and instead honed their hatred into surgical precision. They strike from darkness with uncanny speed, severing life threads and consuming spiritual essence to extend their own twisted unlife. Though intelligent, they are cold and clinical, stalking prey with strategic obsession. Even in battle, they remain composed, avoiding reckless engagements and punishing openings with fatal efficiency. Only the searing power of radiant magic seems to truly slow their pursuit.
