- **Appearance:** The Velmourn is a spectral assassin clad in crimson-black garments that shimmer like dried blood under moonlight. Its gaunt, angular body appears half-corporeal, bones jutting beneath semi-ethereal flesh. Rune-etched daggers in its hands seem to drink the light around them, glowing faintly with stolen souls. A ragged hood conceals most of its visage, save for its glowing red eyes and a thin, eternal grin etched into its withered cheeks. It moves without sound—fluid, deliberate, and predatory, a shadow honed into murder.
- **Disposition:** Velmourns are cursed assassins, born of violent death and refusal to fade. Their hatred sharpens into surgical precision, making them cold and calculating predators. They stalk prey with unerring patience, studying patterns before striking at fatal weaknesses. Every strike steals not only blood, but fragments of the soul, feeding their longevity. Though intelligent, they are entirely detached, devoid of mercy, killing as efficiently as they breathe. Only radiant magic disrupts their relentless pursuit, cutting through their shadow-bound essence.
