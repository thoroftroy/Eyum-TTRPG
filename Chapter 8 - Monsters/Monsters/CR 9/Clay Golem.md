- **Appearance:** The Clay Golem is a hulking effigy of kiln-baked clay, its body webbed with hairline cracks that glow faintly like embers beneath a glaze. Its heavy, broad features still show the thumbprints of its shaper, though its mouth is a mere horizontal slit, opening only to unleash booming bellows. Each lumbering step shakes the earth, and as its body cracks under stress, it erupts into furious bursts of strength until nothing around it stands intact.
- **Disposition:** A berserker servitor with no thought but obedience. Once ordered to destroy, it will stop at nothing—smashing walls, toppling barricades, and trampling foes beneath its bulk. It fights without hesitation, ignoring pain and relentlessly hammering until only rubble remains. When cracks deepen in its body, it abandons restraint entirely, tearing foes apart in reckless flurries before its form collapses into dust.
