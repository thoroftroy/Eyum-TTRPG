Appearance: Black-iron skin veined with dull orange heat lines; hair braided with cinder-wire and slag beads. Their greatswords are forge-long slabs that shed sparks when dragged over stone. The air around them smells of quenched steel and soot; bootprints brand the ground with gray ash.  
Disposition: Siege-breakers and disciplinarians. A fire giant advances in a shielded wedge, smashing cover and forcing defenders into open lanes where its reach dominates. It targets armored foes first—professional contempt—and uses thrown metal debris to harry runners. If threatened by cold or water magic, it presses harder to end the fight before its heat gutters.
