- **AC:** 40
- **HP:** 1,056 (48d12+432)
- **Vitality:** 528 (32d10+336)
- **Speed:** 40 ft
- **Size:** Huge (12–14 ft tall, 2,000–3,000 lbs)
- **Appearance:** The Fire Giant looms like a walking forge, its black-iron skin laced with glowing orange fissures of heat. Hair braided with slag-wire and beads of molten stone smolders faintly, and every motion sheds sparks like a smith’s hammer. Its greatsword is a forge-length slab of burning steel that screams against stone when dragged, leaving trails of fire in its wake. The air reeks of soot and scorched metal, and every bootprint it leaves brands the ground in ash.
- **Disposition:** Masters of siege and discipline, Fire Giants advance in iron wedges, smashing fortifications and forcing defenders into the open where their reach and burning weapons dominate. They harbor contempt for armored opponents, seeking to crush them first as a matter of pride. Against cold or water magic, their fury redoubles—they press relentlessly, seeking to end battles before their inner flames can be quenched.
