Appearance: An ancient oak walking on root-legs, bark knotted into a stern face, leaves whispering with more than wind. Moss veils the shoulders; birds nest in crown-branches that creak like old ships.  
Disposition: Patient guardian that values ground more than blood. It holds still until axes bite or fires are set, then strides to stamp the threat flat and scatter sparks with sweeping arms. It herds foes away from saplings and calls nearby trees to uproot and march. When wounded, it kneels among stones and stills itself, indistinguishable from a grove statue until danger passes.
