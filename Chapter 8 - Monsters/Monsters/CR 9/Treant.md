- **Appearance:** A Treant is an ancient oak given form, its root-like legs carrying its towering frame with the weight of centuries. Its bark is knotted into a stern, furrowed face, while moss drapes across its broad shoulders. Birds nest among its crown-branches, which creak like the hull of an old ship when it moves. Each step trembles the earth, and when it raises its limbs, they sway like storm-swept boughs.
- **Disposition:** Patient guardians, Treants prize soil and grove above all else. They remain still until axes bite or fire threatens, then unleash crushing blows to scatter sparks and stamp intruders into the ground. They herd foes away from saplings and rally nearby trees to rise and join the defense. When deeply wounded, they still themselves, blending seamlessly into the grove until danger fades, awaiting the next trespass.
