Appearance: Ezereth is a titanic cosmic entity, its serpentine body formed from seething strands of raw starlight and void-matter that twist and bend the fabric of space itself. A vast, impossible maw dominates its front, layered with interlocking teeth that shimmer with gravitational distortion. Countless eyes, some massive, others microscopic, dot its length, blinking asynchronously with malicious intelligence. Wherever it moves, the stars seem to dim, and the air groans as if creation itself fears being undone.
Disposition: Ezereth is annihilation made aware, a being that drifts between planes to consume entire realms, driven not by hunger but by inevitability. It does not rage or plot, it erases. It unthreads destiny, devours souls, and reduces continents to silence. Those who gaze into its eyes see not death, but the absence of meaning. In combat, it warps gravity, shatters reality, and absorbs the vitality of anything it touches, growing stronger with each act of destruction. There is no reasoning with Ezereth, only delaying the moment it turns its gaze upon your world.
