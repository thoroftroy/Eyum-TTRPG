Appearance: Orrakar stands as a towering celestial terror clad in radiant obsidian armor that seems to reflect not light, but the downfall of civilizations. Its burning eyes pierce through souls, not merely gazing, but judging. Its face is concealed behind a helm inscribed with runes from the birth of time, and its limbs glow faintly with the pressure of coiled, divine force. It radiates an aura of cosmic dread, warping the air with divine gravity and making even the bravest hearts falter in its shadow.
Disposition: Orrakar is the final decree of failing stars, a herald of balance so absolute that life, death, and law are meaningless in its presence. It does not hate, nor does it favor, it ends. Orrakar arrives only when the universe demands correction, when celestial laws are sundered by mortal ambition or divine hubris. In battle, it strikes with force enough to level mountains, while its very presence unravels magic, warps fate, and silences prophecy. It cannot be reasoned with, for it speaks only in finalities, and only those who transcend existence may hope to stand against it.
