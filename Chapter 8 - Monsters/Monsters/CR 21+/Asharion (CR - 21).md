Appearance: Asharion is a titanic phoenix wreathed in eternal fire, its wings composed of roiling magma and solar flame that unfurl across the sky like a second sun. Its feathers drip molten embers with every beat, leaving trails of fire that linger in the air like burning banners. Its eyes blaze like twin eclipses, and its voice is a searing shriek that cracks the sky. Even gazing upon it for too long scorches the mind, and when it descends, the very earth smolders beneath its shadow.
Disposition: Asharion is not a creature, it is a reckoning. Manifesting only during omens of great devastation or in response to catastrophic imbalance, it does not negotiate or spare. It incinerates armies with sweeping firestorms and rises from death with renewed fury, each resurrection more radiant than the last. Though intelligent and ancient, it is bound to a purpose beyond mortal comprehension, cleansing through flame, ending through light. Only the deepest cold can slow its advance, but even frost must fear what survives the ashes.
