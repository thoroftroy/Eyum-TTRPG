Appearance: Desiccated scholar-king in rotting finery, with pinprick blue flames in hollow eyes. Rings and wands fuse to bone as if grown there; every motion sheds a little dust of centuries. Its presence tastes like old parchment and the metal tang of a storm.  
Disposition: Absolute control and impossible patience. The lich fights three battles at once—on the map, in the mind, and over time. It opens with wards, seals escape routes, and uses minions like chess pieces to force bad trades. If bloodied, it dissolves into shadow corridors while traps and curses keep the party busy. A phylactery ensures the war continues on a later, worse day.
