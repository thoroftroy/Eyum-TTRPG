Appearance: The True King of the Void is not so much seen as endured. A towering figure cloaked in fathomless darkness, it exists in a constant state of phase, flickering between dimensions with every breath. Its silhouette is fluid, fractal, and immense, swathed in a cloak of swirling black starfire, with countless eyes and mouths appearing and vanishing across its shape in rhythmic chaos. Its presence devours light, hope, and reason. Those who gaze upon it do not scream, they forget why they ever knew how.
Disposition: The True King of the Void is the absolute end, the god beyond gods, the ruler of the final silence. It does not conquer, because there is nothing it does not already own. Its will supersedes the multiverse, and its thoughts define the very fabric of existence. All beings below it exist by tolerance alone. It does not rage, punish, or desire, it simply decides. In combat, it wields power beyond any form of opposition: issuing commands that override autonomy, obliterating matter, soul, and memory with a gesture, and once per day, removing something from the universe entirely. No save. No trace. No return. It is not a final boss. It is the final truth.
