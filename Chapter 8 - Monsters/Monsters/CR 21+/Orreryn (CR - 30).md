Appearance: Orreryn is a towering being of impossible majesty, cloaked in endless layers of shimmering cosmic fabric that ripple with the movement of stars and distant galaxies. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of eyes cover its vast form, each blinking in perfect synchronization or dissonant patterns that defy comprehension. Its voice is felt more than heard, vibrating in the bones of gods and reshaping language itself in the minds of mortals. Light bends around it, thought stutters near it, and to look upon it directly is to feel yourself observed in ways no mind should endure.
Disposition: Orreryn is not a ruler by choice, it is dominion. The concept of sovereignty crystallized into will. It was not born but coalesced from the need for order where none could exist. Orreryn does not destroy, it subjugates. Entire pantheons have bent before its gaze, entire worlds realigned to serve its psychic network of control. In combat, it is omniscient, unyielding, and absolute. Its gaze twists reality, its mind overwhelms even demigods, and only those bearing the tools of creationâ€™s first fire may end its reign. To defy Orreryn is to defy the notion that anything exists apart from its will.
