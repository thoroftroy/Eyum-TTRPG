Appearance: Sun-forged perfection—wing-pinions like living gold, skin bright as dawn through stained glass, and a nimbus that paints true color onto lies. Its blade is a line of daylight, its bow a curve of horizon. In its presence, shadows shorten and oaths tighten.  
Disposition: War made holy. The solar enters like a sunrise—warning first, then blinding action. It strips a battlefield of concealment, lifts allies on warm thermals of conviction, and unstrings tyrants with surgical, luminous violence. When faced with impossible odds, it widens the frame: destroy the siege engines, topple the standard, end the war instead of the skirmish.
