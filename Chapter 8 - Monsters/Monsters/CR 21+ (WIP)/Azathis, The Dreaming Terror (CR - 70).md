Appearance: Azathis is a living contradiction, a shape without shape, a color that cannot be named. Its titanic form looms between dimensions, comprised of endless, coiling tentacles that twist through unreality and shimmer with hues that fray the minds of those who perceive them. Its surface ripples like liquid thought, constantly reforming itself with impossible angles and shifting geometries. The world bends around it, as if resisting the truth of its presence. No two creatures see the same thing when they look upon Azathis, only the overwhelming certainty that it should not exist.
Disposition: Azathis does not act, it dreams. And what it dreams becomes real. It is the end of sanity given motion, the final question that no mind can survive asking. Its very presence unravels logic, causality, and identity. Empires crumble in its wake not by war, but by forgetting they ever were. In battle, Azathis does not merely damage, it unmakes perception. Reality bends to its will, reshaped by thought alone. No force resists it, for even resistance is subject to Cosmic Rewrite, the ability to alter the fundamental laws of the multiverse at will. To face Azathis is not to fight, it is to be rewritten, repurposed, or undone.
