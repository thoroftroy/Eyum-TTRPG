Appearance: Xerathis stands as the embodiment of final judgment, a 150-foot celestial giant cloaked in divine fire, its form barely visible beneath an ever-burning storm of radiant energy. Its golden armor blazes like the core of a star, each plate inscribed with runes older than time. Six wings of searing light stretch wide, illuminating entire battlefields with holy brilliance, and its gaze alone can vaporize matter. The air around it hums with raw creation and unmaking, reality twisting to accommodate its impossible presence.
Disposition: Xerathis is not merely the end, it is the divine act of closure. A being born when the stars first knew silence, Xerathis is summoned only when the universe itself declares an era must end. It does not destroy out of hatred or vengeance, but out of transcendent purpose, cleansing what no longer belongs in the tapestry of existence. Its blows shatter stars, its voice silences realms, and its will rewrites the laws that bind gods and mortals alike. Resistance is not battle, it is defiance against divinity itself. Xerathis is the final word.
