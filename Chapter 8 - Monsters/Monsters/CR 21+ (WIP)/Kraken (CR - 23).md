Appearance: A cathedral of muscle and scars—mantle pitted from harpoons, eyes like drowned lanterns, and arms that move with terrifying patience. Lightning crawls over its skin in storms, grounding into the sea with snaps like breaking anchors.  
Disposition: A calamity that thinks in currents. It capsizes ships not out of malice but because ships are obstacles. In combat it treats the party as bits of wreckage to be sorted: one arm to pull the caster under, another to pry the fighter off the mast, a third to crush the cleric’s bell. It darkens the battlefield with ink and thunder, then decides who lives by who can still swim.

Tentacle (x3): Melee Attack +17 to hit (reach 30 ft), 4d10+10 bludgeoning; on hit, Grappled (escape DC 20).  
Fling: A creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 ft; on landing, take 4d6 bludgeoning.  
Lightning Storm (Recharge 5–6): The kraken calls three bolts within 120 ft; each target makes a DC 20 DEX save or takes 8d10 lightning (half on success).  
Ink Cloud (Recharge 6): In water, creates a 60-ft-radius heavily obscured area; the kraken may immediately Swim up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
