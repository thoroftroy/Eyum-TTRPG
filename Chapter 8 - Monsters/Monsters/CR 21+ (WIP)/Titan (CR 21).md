Appearance: The Titan is a colossal humanoid formed from shattered mountains and broken bedrock, its cracked stone body veined with molten glow that pulses like a dying worldâ€™s heartbeat. Its silhouette is jagged and unnatural, shoulders like cliffs, fists like siege engines, and a head crowned with a ring of weathered spires. With every step, the ground groans and splits beneath its weight, and the air around it is thick with drifting dust and the scent of scorched earth. Its gaze is slow and hollow, not blind, just far too ancient to care what it sees.
Disposition: The Titan is ruin given form. It does not seek conquest or glory, it exists to end, to grind civilizations to gravel and leave only silence behind. Once awakened, it marches with glacial inevitability, immune to fear, pain, or reason. Its presence bends reality: walls crumble, courage falters, and entire legions break before ever raising a blade. The Titan does not speak, it does not rest, and it cannot be diverted. Only raw elemental disruption, particularly lightning, has any hope of shattering its momentum. Even then, the world may never heal from where it walked.
