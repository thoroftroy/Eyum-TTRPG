Appearance: The Devouring Singularity is not a creature in the traditional sense, it is a hovering sphere of absolute blackness, a perfect void 50 feet in diameter that swallows not only light, but time, gravity, and meaning. Around it, space bends like liquid, stars twist into impossible shapes, and the laws of physics stutter in panic. Matter is torn into streamers of atoms as they spiral into its gravity well, and reality frays into unreadable fragments just by proximity. No sound escapes it. No light reflects from it. It is hunger made form.
Disposition: The Devouring Singularity has no mind, no intent, no will, only function. It is a universal failsafe, a godless eraser summoned only when reality must be broken to be reborn. Its presence signifies the unraveling of all resistance, for it cannot be bargained with, wounded, slowed, or destroyed. It does not move, it pulls. Every moment it exists is a countdown to the erasure of all within its reach. It cannot be reasoned with, for it has never acknowledged the existence of anything but itself. Its single attack, Gravity Annihilation, does not damage bodies, it annihilates context.
