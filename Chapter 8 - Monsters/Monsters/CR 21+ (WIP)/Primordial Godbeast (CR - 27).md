Appearance: The Primordial Godbeast is a colossal force of celestial majesty, its 100-foot frame cloaked in radiant white-gold fur or scales that shimmer with divine brilliance. Its horns rise like twin spires of sanctified crystal, glowing with primordial energy, and its eyes gleam with unfathomable serenity and judgment. Wings made of woven starlight stretch across the heavens, trailing light and cosmic harmony in their wake. Its very form warps gravity, parting clouds and silencing all sound within miles when it moves.
Disposition: The Primordial Godbeast is the silent will of creation incarnate, neither good nor evil, but balance given breath. It slumbers beyond the stars, stirring only when the fabric of reality faces annihilation or when divinity itself falters. In battle, it is nothing short of cataclysmic: a being of raw judgment that crushes even gods beneath its charge and heals faster than the cosmos can keep up. To witness it is to feel the presence of something older than time and greater than will. It does not fight for victory, it restores what should be. Those who defy it rarely understand they were judged long before they raised their blades.
