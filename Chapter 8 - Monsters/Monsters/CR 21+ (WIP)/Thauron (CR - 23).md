Appearance: Thauron is a continent-sized harbinger of annihilation, a mountainous titan of obsidian flesh split by glowing fault lines of molten fury. Standing over 80 feet tall, its form radiates blistering heat and gravity-warping pressure, its limbs crowned with jagged peaks and seething with magma. Each step quakes the land for miles, and its eyes blaze with primeval fire, silent, eternal, and absolute. Even approaching Thauron feels like trespassing into the final heartbeat of the world.
Disposition: Thauron is not a creature that fights, it ends. Awakened only in the final hours of balance-breaking cataclysm, Thauron does not rage or reason; it marches, its presence alone toppling mountains and sundering continents. Its blows are planetary events, and it shrugs off attacks like a god ignoring insects. Though mindless in the mortal sense, its path is unwavering and terrifyingly purposeful. Only thunderous force, pure disruption against the rhythm of the earth, can hope to stagger it. And even then, it is not victory, only delay.
