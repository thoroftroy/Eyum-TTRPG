Appearance: The Black Maw of Oblivion is a planet-sized sphere of absolute darkness, hovering weightlessly across space and dimensions. No surface defines it, only swirling layers of negative light, punctuated by pulses of ancient, unknowable energy that ripple through the void. Around it, time bends, gravity inverts, and even thoughts begin to fray. Its voice is silence devouring sound, and its eye, if it has one, is the absence of all things, reflecting not what is, but what will never be again.
Disposition: The Black Maw of Oblivion is not a destroyer. It is what remains when even destruction has ended. It does not rage, nor reason, nor hunger in a mortal sense, it absorbs. Worlds, gods, memories, and souls are drawn into it, never to return, as it expands its domain of nothingness across existence. Each creature it consumes is not merely slain, it is erased, and its essence twisted into the Mawâ€™s ever-growing anomaly. No power can seal it, no barrier can stall it, and no weakness can be found in something that has already consumed the concept of weakness. To fight the Maw is not to win, it is to matter before vanishing.
