Appearance: Xal’Zareth is an unfathomably massive serpent, its celestial body woven from the fabric of collapsing galaxies and coiling nebulae. Stars flicker within its scales, and each movement reshapes the starlight around it like ripples on an infinite sea. Its wings are not wings at all, but curtains of void stuff trailing behind it like gravitational scars, and its deep-violet eyes hold the silent will of a universe watching itself die. When it flies, it does not soar, it bends space to accommodate its passing.
Disposition: Xal’Zareth is not death, but the unmaking that follows it. An ancient force birthed from the void between the first stars, it exists to unravel creation, thought, form, soul. It does not communicate, reason, or rage. It simply erases. The strongest of beings are reduced to memory in its presence, and even memory falters in time. Only the most mythic interventions can delay it, never stop it, for to oppose Xal’Zareth is to deny gravity, silence, and time themselves. When it comes, worlds vanish not in fire or flood, but in quiet.
