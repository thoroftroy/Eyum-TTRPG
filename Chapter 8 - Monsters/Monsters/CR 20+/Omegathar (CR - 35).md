Appearance: Omegathar stands as the final testament of cosmic war, a 120-foot humanoid monolith forged from celestial alloys and stitched with constellations across its armored frame. Its body radiates a cold starlight, and the runes etched along its limbs hum with the resonance of finality itself. When it moves, gravity bends, time slows, and weaker minds shatter beneath the pressure of its mere presence. The ground trembles not from impact, but in anticipation.
Disposition: Omegathar is the Omega, the last, the end, the titan that walks when all hope of balance, order, or resistance has fallen. It is not alive, but awakened. Born from the convergence of collapsing timelines and galactic entropy, Omegathar is an extinction-level being set in motion by the universe itself. It does not think as mortals do, nor does it hesitate. It delivers annihilation as a constant, unchangeable, unreasoning, unrelenting. No force may bend it, no magic may bind it, and no god may halt it. Those who stand before Omegathar do not fight for victory, they fight to delay the inevitable.
