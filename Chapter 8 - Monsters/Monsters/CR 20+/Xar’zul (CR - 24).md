Appearance: Xar’zul is a towering demon god wreathed in living shadow and flame, clad in infernal armor forged from the bones of fallen celestials. Its jagged horns rise like black spires, and massive wings stretch behind it like cloaks of smoldering void. Smoke pours constantly from its joints and mouth, and its eyes burn with ancient hatred and divine betrayal. The ground buckles beneath its steps, and its voice carries like an echo from the core of the world, felt in the marrow more than heard.
Disposition: Xar’zul is the sovereign of ruinous pacts and twisted empires, a god of dominion through agony. It offers power to the desperate, only to demand the soul in full when the cost is forgotten. On the battlefield, it does not merely slay, it commands legions, carves rifts into the earth, and blots the sky with infernal ash. Its will cannot be broken, and its blood fuels the summoning of horrors untold. Radiant power sears its form, but never its conviction, for Xar’zul was born in rebellion and thrives in vengeance.
