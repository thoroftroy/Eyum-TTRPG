# Eyum-TTRPG

**The World of Eyum** is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) inspired by Dungeons & Dragons 5e, rebuilt for long-term scalability and a consistent, integrated magic system. At its core, it’s a collaborative storytelling game: players control unique characters while a Narrator or Game Master (GM) presents the world, portrays its inhabitants, and adjudicates outcomes. The goal isn’t to “win” but to **tell memorable stories together**, whether in a single-session one-shot or a long campaign where your characters rise from humble beginnings to world-shaping heroes.

This repository is part of an ongoing project to turn the Eyum **Handbook** into a **wiki-style reference**. Right now, the content is written for and in **Obsidian**, but we are gradually adding links, navigation, and formatting so that it functions as a full wiki you can browse and use online. This is mostly functional at this point but not always up to date. 

The wiki is available here https://thoroftroy.github.io/Eyum-TTRPG/Chapter-1---Introduction/1.0-Table-of-Contents

## How to Use This Project
- If you’re **new to Eyum**, start with **Chapter 2: Core Rules** ([[2.1 Basic Mechanics]]) in the handbook/wiki. It gives the essential mechanics for play (rolling dice, taking actions, how turns work).
- If you’re **building a character**, follow **Chapter 3: Character Creation** [[3.1 Step-by-Step Character Creation]] step-by-step. The GM will guide as needed.
- If you’re a **Game Master**, focus on ★-marked sections (like worldbuilding, optional rules, and guidance chapters).
- The repo is structured so you can **jump directly** to the parts you need without reading cover-to-cover. Think of it as a living reference manual.

## Current Status
This project is **work in progress**. Some sections are fully written, others are placeholders or need revision. We are testing, expanding, and balancing as the system develops.

## TO-DO
- Create images for each monster, deity, class, etc.
- Balance the classes and races:
    - Test races by creating Fighter/Wizard builds at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20.
    - Test classes by creating a character for every level in every class and running mock battles.
	    - I have balanced the classes much better but further testing would be good
- Test with actual players:
    - I have done this once and fixed everything from the previous testing
- Test with **new players** to ensure systems are learnable without external help.
- Cross-reference with 5e for missing sections:
    - Map/city building details
    - Campaign/world creation guides (WIP)
    - Dungeon creation guide
    - NPC/DMPC play guidance
    - Starting area recommendations
- Expand race list, especially animal-type races (bat, cat, cow, etc.)
