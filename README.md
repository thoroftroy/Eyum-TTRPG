# Eyum-TTRPG
Updating the handbook into more of a wiki styled handbook. This is very much a work in progress. 





#### **TO-DO**

Re-balance Spells, Each Class should have spells which do all of the following (one or two flavors of each). Also include unique spells for each class that don't fit into these categories, we don't need to necessarily remove or add spells, just change redundant spells to be more unique. Each classes variants of the spells should be specialized for that class. For example, the battlefield control spells for wizard should be more powerful and use less mana and direct offense for warlock should be more powerful and use less mana and so on. Specialized spells should also have more prerequisites. 
#### **Direct Offense**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Make images for each monster/deity/class/ect
- Balance the classes and races
	- To balance the races create one character at levels 5,10,15,20 in fighter and wizard with each race and see how they do. Much more testing than that is likely going to be required there are so many races though. 
	- To balance classes create a character for every level in every class and compare them in mock battles
- Make a table of contents
- Actually test the system with some real players to figure out balancing
	- Martial characters feel pretty good at low levels right now but mages run out of mana so fast it is nearly impossible to play a caster at level 1
	- It has now been tested once, it needs a lot of changes (most I have already made, but more testing is required)
- Test the handbook with new players, see if they can figure out the systems without my help
- Go through Dungeon and Dragons 5e handbooks and see if there is any information in them which isn’t in mine, things I am missing. So Far I have found things that are missing or not well explained to be the following:
	- Create more detailed guides on starting equipment/money
		- On that note be more detailed in basically every section
	- Create a lot more gear/weapons/armor types
	- Equipment packs
	- Details about building maps and cities
	- Specific guides on creating a campaign world
	- A dungeon creation guide
	- Treasure section
	- More details on magic items, provide a lot more specific examples (The DM’s guide for Dnd has like 200 pages of just items)
	- A section explaining how to play an NPC or a DMPC 
	- Diseases and Poisons (At least more details on them)
	- Injuries and Lingering Injuries
	- Sections on creating spells, classes, and races. I have a detailed section explaining monster creation but nothing else
	- Starting area recommendations
	- Doors/things with medium or high toughness/damage resistance (requires at least a roll of 20 damage to do anything or such)
- Put page number references in sections like the step by step character creation part (This is being replaced with the WIKI creation so I can just put links)
