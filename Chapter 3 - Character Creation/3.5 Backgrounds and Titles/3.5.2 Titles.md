A title is more than just a name, it’s your character’s reputation, legacy, and identity. Titles are earned through significant achievements or actions that impact a large group of people. They are a mark of honor (or infamy) and can shape how others perceive and interact with your character.
##### Why Have a Title?
Titles serve two main purposes:
1. Convey Authority: Titles like “Lord of Genflen” or “High Priest of Eldath” signify leadership or status.
2. Convey Feats: Titles like “Dragonslayer” or “Hero of Eyum” highlight extraordinary accomplishments.

Titles are given, not chosen, and are often bestowed by deities, rulers, or communities. For example:
- Becoming the ruler of a city might grant you the title “Lord of Genflen.”
- Leading a massacre might earn you the title “Deathbringer.”

Titles can become so well-known that people recognize you more by your title than your name. However, not all titles are positive, infamous titles like “Warlord” or “Betrayer” can lead to fear or hostility.
##### Title Bonuses
Titles often come with small bonuses tied to their nature. These bonuses are determined by the GM and reflect the title’s significance. For example:
- Lord of Genflen: +2 Charisma or advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with subjects of that land.
- Deathbringer: -2 Charisma and advantage on attacks against innocent people.

Bonuses are entirely at the GM’s discretion and should align with the title’s meaning and how it was earned.
##### Self-Assigned Titles
While titles are typically earned, characters can assign themselves titles. However, self-assigned titles only provide bonuses if the character lives up to the title’s expectations. For example:
- A character calling themselves “Hero of Eyum” won’t gain any bonuses until they perform heroic deeds worthy of the title.

Self-assigned titles are more about role-playing and establishing a reputation than providing mechanical benefits.
##### Gods and Titles
Deities often grant titles to mortals as a sign of recognition. These titles are usually bestowed upon clerics, paladins, or other devout followers. Examples include:
- Champion of (God’s Name)
- Harbinger of (God’s Domain)

The bonuses granted by divine titles are limited by the deity’s power. For example, a minor deity might grant a small bonus, while a major deity could provide significant benefits.
##### Multiple Titles
As your character progresses, they may earn multiple titles. You can choose to introduce yourself with any or all of your titles, and you gain the bonuses from all titles. For example:
- A character might be both “Lord of Genflen” and “Dragonslayer,” gaining bonuses from both titles.
##### Losing a Title
Titles can be revoked or replaced if a character fails to live up to them. For example:
- A character with the title “Champion of the People” who begins attacking innocents might lose their title and gain a new one like “False Champion.”
- Revoked titles often come with negative effects, such as penalties to Charisma or disadvantage on social checks.
