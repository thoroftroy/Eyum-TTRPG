When leveling up, if you reach a point where your normal progression options are exhausted, you gain alternative benefits:
- If you have learned all spells in a spell group but still need to learn a new one, you may instead choose a spell from any other class.
- Once you have learned all available spells, gain +10 maximum Mana.
- If you cannot gain additional proficiency or expertise in a weapon, you may instead take +3 skill points.
- If you cannot take another feat, you may also choose to gain +3 stat points as an alternative.
- When you take a proficiency or expertise upgrade, unless specified, it may be used for a weapon type or a skill. 

Skill Points vs. Stat Points
- A Skill Point increases a specific skill (e.g., Athletics, Stealth, Arcana).
- A Stat Point increases one of your six core attributes (e.g., Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence).

These are tracked separately and affect your character in different ways.
##### Class Level Benefits and Scaling
Each class grants its own unique benefits at specific levels. These class-specific bonuses stack with both:
- The universal benefits that all classes receive
- Any other bonuses granted by multiclassing
When you reach a new level in a class, you gain all benefits associated with that level and any benefits tied to thresholds below it (e.g., every 2 levels, every 3 levels, etc.).
