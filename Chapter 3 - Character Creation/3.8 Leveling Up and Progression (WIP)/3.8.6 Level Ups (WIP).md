When leveling up, if you reach a point where your normal progression options are exhausted, you gain alternative benefits:

- If you have learned all spells in a spell group but still need to learn a new one, you may instead choose a spell from any other class.
    
- Once you have learned all available spells, gain +10 maximum Mana.
    
- If you cannot gain additional proficiency or expertise in a weapon, you may instead take +3 skill points.
    
- If you cannot take another feat, you may also choose to gain +3 skill points as an alternative.
    

Skill Points vs. Stat Points

- A Skill Point increases a specific skill (e.g., Athletics, Stealth, Arcana).
    
- A Stat Point increases one of your six core attributes (e.g., Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence).
    

These are tracked separately and affect your character in different ways.

##### Class Level Benefits and Scaling

Each class grants its own unique benefits at specific levels. These class-specific bonuses stack with both:

- The universal benefits that all classes receive
    
- Any other bonuses granted by multiclassing
    

When you reach a new level in a class, you gain all benefits associated with that level and any benefits tied to thresholds below it (e.g., every 2 levels, every 3 levels, etc.).

##### Progression Patterns

Class features are typically granted at the following intervals:

- Every Level:  
    Levels 1-20
    
- Every 2 Levels:  
    Levels 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
    
- Every 3 Levels:  
    Levels 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18
    
- Every 4 Levels:  
    Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20
    
- Every 10 Levels:  
    Levels 10, 20
    

Your class table will specify which benefits follow each interval. These features accumulate, so reaching level 6, for example, would give you benefits from:

- Level 6 (every level)
    
- Level 6 (every 2 levels)
    
- Level 6 (every 3 levels)
    

And so on.
