As you level up, you can increase your stats. However, increasing stats above 20 becomes progressively more expensive. If you donâ€™t have enough points to increase a stat by a full point, you can save the remaining points for later. Simply note the unspent points above your stats.

#### 3.7.8 Stat Point Cost Table

The cost to increase a stat doubles every 10 levels:

| Stat Range | Cost per Point |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 1 - 20     | 1              |
| 21 - 30    | 2              |
| 31 - 40    | 4              |
| 41 - 50    | 8              |
| 51 - 60    | 16             |
| 61 - 70    | 32             |
| 71 - 80    | 64             |
| 81 - 90    | 128            |
| 91 - 100   | 256            |

Following this formula you can exceed 100 with stats, it just starts taking unrealistically high amounts of stat points well before this.

A similar system is used for increasing Affinity, but the cost doubles every 5 levels.
#### Affinity Point Cost Table

| Affinity Range | Cost per Point |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| -10 - 10       | 1              |
| 11 - 15        | 2              |
| 16 - 20        | 4              |
| 21 - 25        | 8              |
| 26 - 30        | 16             |
| 31 - 35        | 32             |
| 36 - 40        | 64             |
| 41 - 45        | 128            |
| 46 - 50        | 256            |

Similar to the stat points this formula can be followed infinitely, it just becomes unrealistic to go higher after a certain point.
