Every class in The World of Eyum follows the same leveling system. A character may reach up to level 20 in a primary class, and at any level-up, they may choose to multiclass instead of continuing in the same class.

There are two methods for leveling:

1. XP-Based Progression (mathematical tracking)
    

Milestone Leveling (GM-controlled narrative advancement)
