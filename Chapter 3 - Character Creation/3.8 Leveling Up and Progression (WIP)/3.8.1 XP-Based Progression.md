The XP system in Eyum is split into three phases:

##### Phase 1: Levels 1 to 20 - Gradually Increasing

This phase simulates early adventuring. XP costs start modest and rise steadily but not too quickly.

- Level 1 is free (you start at 0 XP).
    
- Level 2 requires 1,000 XP.
    
- From there, each level costs more than the last, with the increase growing slightly at each step.
    

Formula (for levels 2 to 20):

XP required to level up = 1000 + 100 × (L − 2) + 100 × (L − 2)(L − 1)/2

This equation has three parts:

1. 1000: the base cost to reach level 2.
    
2. 100 × (L − 2): adds 100 XP per level after level 2.
    
3. 100 × (L − 2)(L − 1)/2: increases the amount gained per level at a mild accelerating rate.
    

This is effectively a quadratic curve that grows steadily but remains manageable for normal campaigns.

##### Phase 2: Levels 21 to 30 - Major Power Spike

Level 20 represents the end of normal mortal progression. Beyond this point, characters are entering high-powered, epic-tier gameplay.

- The XP required to level up jumps dramatically.
    
- This spike separates regular progression from post-legendary scaling.
    

Formula (for levels 21 to 30):

XP required to level up = 10,000 × (L − 20)

So:

- Level 21 costs 10,000 XP.
    
- Level 22 costs 20,000 XP.
    
- Level 30 costs 100,000 XP to reach.
    

This linear formula increases XP by a flat 10,000 per level, starting at Level 21.

##### Phase 3: Levels 31 to 300 - High-Level Linear Scaling

After Level 30, the XP cost stabilizes into a more sustainable high-level progression.

- XP required per level still increases, but at a slower and consistent rate.
    
- This phase supports long-term, high-level campaigns (divine, cosmic, or planar in scale).
    

Formula (for levels 31 to 300):

XP required to level up = 130,000 + 15,000 × (L − 30)

- Level 31 costs 145,000 XP.
    
- Level 32 costs 160,000 XP.
    
- Each new level adds 15,000 more XP to the requirement.
    

The number 130,000 ensures continuity from the earlier spike, keeping the curve smooth across transitions.

##### Total XP to Reach a Given Level

If you want to calculate the total XP needed to reach any level (not just the XP between two levels), you add together all the individual XP requirements for each level up to that point.

In math terms:

Total XP to reach level L = sum of XP_to_Level(k) from k = 2 to L

So for example:

- To reach level 5, you add the XP required for levels 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    
- To reach level 21, you sum the XP required from level 2 through 21.
    

This gives you the total accumulated XP a character must earn across their whole career.

##### Earning XP from Combat

When characters defeat monsters, they gain XP based on the monster’s Challenge Rating (CR).

XP = CR × 100

This is the base XP per monster, before adjusting for party size or challenge modifiers. The GM may award bonus XP for difficult fights, clever tactics, or defeating enemies far above your level.

##### XP Split Between Party Members

If multiple characters participate, divide the monster’s XP evenly among them unless one player clearly did all the work.

##### Earning XP from Tasks and Quests

You can also gain XP from:

- Completing major quests: 100-1,000 XP
    
- Solving puzzles or riddles: 50-250 XP
    
- Roleplay, diplomacy, or narrative success: 50-300 XP
    
- Surviving dangerous travel: 25-100 XP
    
- Discovering powerful lore or secrets: variable
    

These are guidelines, not fixed numbers. The GM determines rewards based on importance and risk.
