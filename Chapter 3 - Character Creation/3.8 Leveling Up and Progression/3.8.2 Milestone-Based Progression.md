Instead of using XP at all, the Milestone System allows the Game Master to level characters up:

- After completing key story arcs
    
- Following major victories
    
- At the end of chapters or acts
    

This method works best in story-driven campaigns. It allows the GM to balance party power and focus on pacing rather than math.
