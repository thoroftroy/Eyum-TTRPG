- Each class grants proficiency in two specific saving throws.
    
- You are only ever proficient in two saving throws, regardless of multiclassing.
    
- Your saving throw proficiencies are determined by the class in which you have the highest number of levels.
    

Example: If you're a level 7 Fighter / level 3 Wizard, you use the Fighter's saving throw proficiencies.

- If you have equal levels in two or more classes (e.g., 5 Fighter / 5 Wizard), you may choose which class's saving throw proficiencies to use.
    

##### Marking Proficiencies

On your character sheet, place a â˜… or asterisk (*) next to the two saving throw stats you are proficient in. Add your Proficiency Bonus to those rolls when applicable.
