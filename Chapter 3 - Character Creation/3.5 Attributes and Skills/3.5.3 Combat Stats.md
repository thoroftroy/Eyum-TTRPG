In combat, three key stats are crucial: AC, Vit, and HP.

- AC (Armor Class): Determines how hard it is to hit you. An attacker must meet or exceed your AC to deal damage.
    
- Vit (Vitality): Represents your energy or stamina. Most attacks reduce Vit first, representing near-misses or dodges. Some spells or abilities may consume Vit to enhance effects.
    
- HP (Health Points): Represents your actual health. When Vit reaches 0, damage is applied to HP. If HP reaches 0, the character dies. Area-of-effect (AoE) attacks will deal half their damage to Vit and half their damage to HP.
    

Leveling Up: Every level, roll your classâ€™s Vit and HP dice, add your Constitution modifier to each vit roll, and add the total to your current Vit and HP.
