When assigning your character’s stats, you use the Point Buy system:

- All stats start at 8 (-1) by default.
    
- You are given 27 points to allocate across your stats.
    
- You can decrease a stat to a minimum of 4 (-3) to gain additional points for other stats.
    
- The maximum you can normally increase a stat to is 20 (+5). Increasing a stat beyond 20 costs 2 points per +1.
    

More details about this system are in the step by step character creation guide (3.1). 

##### Example: Fighter Build

Here’s an example of a level 1 fighter’s stats:

- Str: 8 + 12 = 20 (+5)
    
- Dex: 8 + 10 = 18 (+4)
    
- Con: 8 + 4 = 12 (+1)
    
- Int: 8 - 4 = 4 (-3)
    
- Wis: 8 - 4 = 4 (-3)
    
- Cha: 8 + 2 = 10 (+0)
    

This fighter is exceptionally strong and agile but lacks intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Balance your stats based on your character’s role and backstory.

Note: Apply any racial modifiers to your stats after allocating points (if this causes a stat to go above 20 make note of it by putting 20.5 so that you know there is an additional point in that skill).
