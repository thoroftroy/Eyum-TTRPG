- Any non-weapon object can be used as an improvised weapon.
- Improvised weapons deal 1d4 damage and require an appropriate attack roll.
- If an improvised weapon closely resembles an existing weapon (e.g., a chair leg as a club), the GM may allow it to deal similar damage.

This is different from an unarmed attack. An unarmed attack just uses your Strength Modifier and nothing else. 

Martial weapons are specialized, often unorthodox weapons commonly used by monks and other hand-to-hand combatants. Unlike standard weapons, they typically lack blades or sharp edges, focusing on speed, control, and technique.

Examples include:
- Nunchaku
- Quarterstaffs
- Tonfa
- Rope darts

Martial weapons are treated as improvised weapons by all classes except monks. This means:
- You do not gain proficiency or expertise bonuses with martial weapons unless a feature explicitly says otherwise.
- They cannot be selected for proficiency upgrades or feats that require weapon proficiency.

Monks, however, are specially trained with these weapons. When a monk uses a martial weapon:
- It counts as an improvised weapon for the purposes of monk features and abilities.
- It deals 1d8 damage, not 1d4.
- The monk gains +1 to hit for each level in monk when using a martial weapon. This replaces proficiency.
- When the monk reaches level 10 they gain advantage on all hits with a martial weapon.

Note: Other classes may use martial weapons, but only monks gain the full benefit from them.
