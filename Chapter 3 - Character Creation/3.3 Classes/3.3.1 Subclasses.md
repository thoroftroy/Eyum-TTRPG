Subclasses are specialized branches of a character’s main class. While your core class defines your primary role (such as Cleric, Fighter, or Sorcerer), your subclass determines a more specific theme, philosophy, or combat style. Subclasses provide unique abilities and bonuses that expand your playstyle, allowing for greater customization and flavor.

Each class has access to multiple subclass options, usually chosen at level 1. Some classes (such as Fighter or Rogue) may offer additional subclass features as you progress.

Example:  
A Cleric might choose the Gravetender subclass to focus on necromancy and resurrection, or the Firelight subclass to emphasize healing and fire magic.

Subclasses typically grant new abilities at specific level thresholds, usually at levels 1, 5, and 10. These features can be spells, passive traits, active powers, or transformations depending on the subclass.

Subclass Feature Scaling

Subclass abilities do not automatically increase in power as your character levels up. Unlike base class features or spells, subclass powers are flat in power unless specifically stated.

If a subclass feature doesn’t say it scales with level, then it does not.

This means:

- Damage numbers, duration, effect size, and uses per day all remain the same across levels, unless explicitly written otherwise.
    
- If a subclass ability says “once per long rest” or “summons 2 minions,” that number does not change unless a feat, class ability, or GM ruling allows it.
    

Subclass features are designed to remain useful and balanced without becoming dominant at higher levels. 

Reminder: Only one subclass may be chosen per class unless a feature or feat allows otherwise.
