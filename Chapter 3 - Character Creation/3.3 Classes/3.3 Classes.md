Note: This section includes all the playable classes. Start by reading the class you want to play, don’t try to understand every class at once. You’ll learn about others as they appear in the game.

All classes, except the Deity class, have a maximum level cap of 20. Once you reach level 20 in a class, you must multiclass into another class to continue leveling.

Note: Multiclassing is generally recommended even before reaching level 20, as it offers greater flexibility and customization.
