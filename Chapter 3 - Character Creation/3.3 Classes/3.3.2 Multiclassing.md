Characters can take levels in multiple classes, gaining abilities from both. This is the recommended way to play. Each class is specialized to one thing, if you put all your eggs in one basket then you will surely fail down the line. 

For example, a level 3 barbarian can have over 50 hp+vit at level 3 where a sorcerer is likely going to only have ~12 hp+vit. This means if you go into full casting  you will likely die in one hit, but if you go into a full melee class like barbarian you will have no utility and not be good at skill checks. 

Multiclassing Rules

1. HP and Mana Growth:
	- When leveling up in a new class, roll that class’s HP, Vitality, and Mana dice instead of your previous class's.
	- Example: A Fighter (1d10 HP) multiclassing into Sorcerer (1d6 HP) will use the 1d6 HP for Sorcerer levels.
