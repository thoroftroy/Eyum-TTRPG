Clerics gain special abilities based on the deity they worship. Their divine power allows them to cast spells, heal, and wield divine energy. If a cleric attempts to do anything that goes against their God’s will their power will not work (at the GM’s discretion).

Clerics are some of the most important classes in the entire game. This is because it is so easy to die and for the most part only a cleric can bring back the dead.
