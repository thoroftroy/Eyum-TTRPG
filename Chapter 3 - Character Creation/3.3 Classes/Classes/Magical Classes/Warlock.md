Warlocks gain magic through a pact with a powerful entity. The nature of their pact influences their abilities. If a warlock does anything that goes against their fiend’s will their power will not work (at the GM’s discretion)

Vitality Conversion (Warlock Exclusive Ability)  
Warlocks can sacrifice their own vitality to restore mana, channeling their pact’s power at a cost. As a bonus action, a warlock may consume 5 Vitality to restore 10 Mana.

- If a warlock consumes 10 or more Vitality in a single turn, they suffer 1d6 Necrotic damage (to HP), ignoring resistances.
    
- This ability does not function while the warlock is exhausted (has any levels of exhaustion).
