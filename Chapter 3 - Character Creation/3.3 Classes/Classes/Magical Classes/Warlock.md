Warlocks gain magic through a pact with a powerful entity. The nature of their pact influences their abilities. If a warlock does anything that goes against their fiend’s will their power will not work (at the GM’s discretion)

- Weapons: Wands, Staffs
- Magical Gain: Warlocks gain magic by sacrificing something valuable in a pact.
- Spellcasting Modifier: Charisma
- Proficiency: Charisma, Constitution saving throws
- Proficiency Bonus: +2 (increases by 1 every 3 levels)
- Proficiency with Light Armor

Hit Dice: 1d6  
Vitality Dice: 1d4  
Mana Dice: 1d8
#### Vitality Conversion  
Warlocks can sacrifice their own vitality to restore mana, channeling their pact’s power at a cost. As a bonus action, a warlock may consume 5 Vitality to restore 10 Mana.
- If a warlock consumes 10 or more Vitality in a single turn, they suffer 1d6 Necrotic damage (to HP), ignoring resistances.
- This ability does not function while the warlock is exhausted (has any levels of exhaustion).
#### Level 1 Feature: Eldritch Shot
Eldritch Shot
- Mana Cost: 0
- Affinity: Generic
- Range: 60ft
- Concentration: No
- Effect: Fires a bolt of pure energy, dealing 1d4 Force damage.
- Upcast: For every 3 additional mana spent deal +1 damage
#### At level 1 a warlock must choose a patron to make a pact with. 
Look through the list of Deities in **Section 3.4 Deities** specifically at the ancients, fathomless, and fiends. You gain the abilities granted from their pact in their description but must act as they would wish or you will lose your powers. The details of the pact should be worked out with your Game Master. A pact will require you to do something specific in return for gaining power such as sacrificing animals or spreading the name of the deity. 
#### Subclasses (Choose 1 at level 3)
Warlocks specialize based on the type of entity they made a pact with.
##### Eldritch Knight (Prerequisite: 1 Level in a Physical Class)
- Warrior’s Spellcraft: Optionally use Strength instead of Charisma for spellcasting.
- Arcane Weapon: Imbue a weapon with magical energy, adding +1d6 damage. As a bonus action you can summon this weapon to you. You may use your Charisma modifier instead of strength or dexterity while attacking with this weapon. 
##### Corpse Mage:
- Raise Minions: Reanimate a corpse as a skeletal minion (1 x warlock level per short rest).
- Necrotic Surge: Once per turn, deal +1d8 necrotic damage on a spell.
##### Darkness King:
- Vampiric Touch: Melee spell attacks heal (vitality) you for half the damage dealt.
- Shadow Walk: Can teleport up to 30 ft in dim light or darkness as a bonus action. You can only use this once every 6 seconds (once per turn regardless of Ap or BAp)
##### Sacrificial Deal:
- Life for Power: Sacrifice your own HP to boost spell damage (1 HP = +3 damage).
- Dark Offering: Each time you kill a creature with a CR ranking equal to half your total level or more recover 25% of your mana at the cost of a bonus action.
