#### Requirements to Become a Deity
- Minimum Level: Must have a total level of 150 before taking Deity levels. 
- Belief Requirement: At least 10 sentient beings must believe in you as a higher power.
- Subclass Selection: A Deity must choose a subclass at level 1 of Deity. Unlike other classes, a Deity may change subclasses every level, with exceptions noted.
- Immortality: A Deity cannot die so long as at least one believer exists. Instead of dying the deity will fall into a coma for 1d4 days each time they die in order to recover. 
#### Divine Power & Magical Gain
A Deity’s strength is directly tied to how they sustain their godhood. Unlike traditional spellcasters, their magic does not come from training or study but rather from their subclass and believers. Once you become a deity you do not gain levels from XP or milestones, instead you gain them in specific ways based on the type of deity you are. Unlike normal levels, deity levels can also be lost. 
- Followers as Fuel: Celestial or Godly Deities gain or lose power based on their number of followers.
- Destruction as Fuel: Fiendish Deities gain power through destruction rather than belief.
- Time as Fuel: Ancient Deities grow stronger simply by existing.
- Chaos as Fuel: Fathomless Deities gain power unpredictably, without control over their own strength.
#### Subclasses (Choose one at level 1)
A Deity’s subclass can change each level, except Ancients and Fathomless Deities, who have permanent restrictions.
##### Fiend
(Prerequisite: Must have committed at least one evil act (GM's Discretion))  
Fiends thrive on chaos and ruin, requiring no followers to maintain their strength. Instead, they gain divine power through destruction.
- Consume the Fallen: Every 100 creatures slain, gain +1 Deity level. Creatures must have a CR of at least 3 to count. 
- Fiendish Hunger: If you (or one of your warlocks) does not kill a creature (CR >3) every week then you will lose a deity level each day after that week. 
- Hellish Presence: Creatures within 50 ft must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10 + Deity level) or suffer 1d8 psychic damage per turn.
##### Celestial 
Celestials act as gods or devils, gaining and losing power based entirely on their followers’ devotion.
- Faith-Driven Strength: Gain +1 Deity level per 1,000 believers. Lose 1 level per 1,000 believers lost.
- Divine Smite: Deal radiant or necrotic damage (3d10) per Deity level to a single target once per short rest.
##### Ancient 
(Prerequisite: Be at least 10,000 years old and have Deity level 1,000+)  
Ancient Deities do not require believers and cannot be killed. Instead, their power grows purely through the passage of time.
- Eternal Power: Gain +1 Deity level per 100 years lived (After taking the subclass).
- Timeless Form: Cannot be destroyed, only sealed away or banished. 
(Warning: Choosing Ancient locks you into this subclass forever. You cannot change again.)
##### Fathomless
(Prerequisite: Deity Level 100+)  
Fathomless Deities exist in a constant state of flux, their power rising and falling unpredictably.
- Unstable Strength: Every long rest you can choose to roll 1d100 to determine gain or loss of Deity levels (These levels are not permanent and reset on your next long rest, they also cannot reduce your level below 100).
- Madness Aura: Any creature that gazes upon you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or become Confused.
(Warning: Choosing Fathomless prevents you from ever becoming Celestial or Fiend. You may still become Ancient.)
