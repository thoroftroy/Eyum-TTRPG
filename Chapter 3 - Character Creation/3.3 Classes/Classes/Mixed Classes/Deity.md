Requirements to Become a Deity

- Minimum Level: Must have a total level of 150 before taking Deity levels.
    
- Belief Requirement: At least 10 sentient beings must believe in you as a higher power.
    
- Subclass Selection: A Deity must choose a subclass at level 1 of Deity. Unlike other classes, a Deity may change subclasses every level, with exceptions noted.
    
- Immortality: A Deity cannot die so long as at least one believer exists.
    

Divine Power & Magical Gain

A Deity’s strength is directly tied to how they sustain their godhood. Unlike traditional spellcasters, their magic does not come from training or study but rather from their subclass and believers.

- Followers as Fuel: Celestial Deities gain or lose power based on their number of followers.
    
- Destruction as Fuel: Fiendish Deities gain power through destruction rather than belief.
    
- Time as Fuel: Ancient Deities grow stronger simply by existing.
    
- Chaos as Fuel: Fathomless Deities gain power unpredictably, without control over their own strength.
    

Subclasses (Choose one at level 1)

A Deity’s subclass can change each level, except Ancients and Fathomless Deities, who have permanent restrictions.

Fiend

(Prerequisite: Must have committed at least one evil act)  
Fiends thrive on chaos and ruin, requiring no followers to maintain their strength. Instead, they gain divine power through destruction.

- Consume the Fallen: Every 100 creatures slain, gain +1 Deity level.
    
- Hellish Presence: Creatures within 50 ft must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10 + Deity level) or suffer 1d8 psychic damage per turn.
    
- Dark Ascension (1/Long Rest): Temporarily double your Deity level for 1 minute, but cause random catastrophic effects in a 100 ft radius.
    

Celestial 

Celestials act as gods or devils, gaining and losing power based entirely on their followers’ devotion.

- Faith-Driven Strength: Gain +1 Deity level per 1,000 believers. Lose 1 level per 500 believers lost.
    
- Divine Smite: Deal radiant or necrotic damage (3d10) per Deity level to a single target once per long rest.
    
- Miracle (1/Long Rest): Expend 500 believers’ faith to perform a godly feat, such as raising the dead, summoning celestial warriors, or bending reality (GM’s discretion).
    

Ancient 

(Prerequisite: Be at least 10,000 years old and have Deity level 5,000+)  
Ancient Deities do not require believers and cannot be killed. Instead, their power grows purely through the passage of time.

- Eternal Power: Gain +1 Deity level per 100 years lived.
    
- Timeless Form: Cannot be destroyed, only sealed away or banished.
    
- Primordial Shift (1/Long Rest): Temporarily pause time for 1 minute, allowing you to act freely while everything else remains frozen.
    

(Warning: Choosing Ancient locks you into this subclass forever. You cannot change again.)

Fathomless

(Prerequisite: Deity Level 500+)  
Fathomless Deities exist in a constant state of flux, their power rising and falling unpredictably.

- Unstable Strength: Every long rest, roll 1d100 to determine gain or loss of Deity levels (GM discretion on amount).
    
- Madness Aura: Any creature that gazes upon you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or suffer random magical effects.
    
- Reality Distortion (1/Long Rest): Randomly alter part of the world, but with uncontrollable side effects.
    

(Warning: Choosing Fathomless prevents you from ever becoming Celestial or Fiend. You may still become Ancient.)
