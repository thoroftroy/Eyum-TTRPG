Magical Gain - Oathbound Magic

Paladins gain their magical abilities through Oaths that define their purpose. If a Paladin fails to uphold their oath, they lose their magic permanently and become an Oathbreaker. Oathbreakers must fulfill their oath through mortal means before regaining their powers.

How to choose an oath?

When you become a Paladin, you must take an Oath, a personal vow that defines your character’s guiding moral principle or code of action. Unlike your subclass, which determines your mechanical features, your Oath is a narrative choice made between you and the GM. It is a statement of conviction that influences how your Paladin behaves, makes decisions, and earns divine favor.An Oath should be:

- Specific enough to create consequences for keeping or breaking it.
    
- Flexible enough that it remains achievable across varied campaigns.
    
- Rooted in conviction, not a casual preference.
    
- Made during character creation, in collaboration with the GM.
    

Your Oath is not a mechanical restriction, but the GM may grant you advantage, bonuses, or narrative miracles when your actions clearly fulfill your Oath in a meaningful way. Likewise, repeated, willful violation of your Oath may lead to becoming an oathbreaker. 

Example Oaths

Oath of Vengeance

"I swear to punish those who wrong the innocent, no matter the cost."

- Broadly justifies aggressive justice.
    
- Supports lone-wolf or hunter playstyles.
    

Oath of Protection

"I vow to shield the weak, even if it means my death."

- Encourages tanking and sacrifice.
    
- Rewards prioritizing others' safety over your own.
    

Oath of Judgment

"All who carry corruption must be purged from this world."

- Creates tension when 'gray areas' arise.
    
- Encourages bold and direct actions.
    

Oath of Peace

"Violence is the last resort; I will exhaust every peaceful path first."

- Great for diplomatic play or redemption arcs.
    
- Still allows combat, but only as a final answer.
    

Oath of Loyalty

"My companions are my cause. I stand with them no matter what."

- Ties your Paladin to the party’s survival and goals.
    
- Excellent for morally gray teams needing a stable core.
    

Paladin Subclasses (Choose 1 at level 3)

Each oath grants different abilities based on a Paladin’s philosophy and dedication.

(These oaths are just the flavor of the subclass not necessarily the actual oath your paladin took. Work with the GM to choose an oath that fits your character)

Holy Warrior

A Holy Warrior is devoted to divine service, fulfilling a religious duty or proving their worth to their deity.

- Divine Wrath: Add +1d8 radiant damage to melee attacks against fiends and undead.
    
- Blessed Shield: Gain +2 AC when using a shield.
    
- Sacred Smite (1/Short Rest): Infuse your weapon with holy power, dealing an extra 2d10 radiant damage.
    

Oracle Seeker

Oracle Seekers dedicate themselves to ensuring prophecies come true, believing destiny must be fulfilled at all costs.

- Foresight’s Blessing: Gain advantage on Situational Insight, Search, Spot, and Investigation checks.
    
- Destined Strike: Once per short rest, reroll an attack roll if it misses.
    
- Prophetic Vision (1/Long Rest): Glimpse the future, allowing you to ask the GM one yes/no question about upcoming events.
    

Selfish Fighter

These Paladins took their oaths not out of devotion or duty, but for their own personal gain, be it power, fame, or revenge.

- Dark Resilience: When below 50% Vitality, gain +1d4 damage on all attacks.
    
- Unyielding Ambition: You may reroll a failed saving throw once per short rest.
    
- Vengeful Strike (1/Short Rest): If an enemy has damaged you within the last round, your next attack deals double damage.
    

World Healer

World Healers are entirely selfless, taking their oaths not for gods or prophecy, but simply to help others.

- Healing Hands: Heal one creature (range touch) for 1 x PaladinLevel health points.
    
- Guardian’s Grace: When you heal an ally, you may transfer half the healing amount to yourself.
    
- Divine Salvation (1/Long Rest): Instantly restore 10d8 HP to one creature (60 ft range).
    

Oathbreaker (Penalty State)

If a Paladin breaks their oath, they immediately suffer the following penalties:

- Magic Sealed: Cannot use paladin spells or divine abilities.
    
- Weakened Soul: -2 to all saving throws.
    
- Fallen Aura: All allies within 10 ft suffer -1 to attack rolls while you remain Oathbroken.
    

To restore their Paladin status, they must fulfill their original oath through mundane means, proving their devotion through actions rather than magic.
