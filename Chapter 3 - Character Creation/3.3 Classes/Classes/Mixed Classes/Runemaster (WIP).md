The Runemaster is a specialized spellcaster who manipulates the power of runes to craft magic in unique ways. Rather than simply casting spells like a traditional mage, they engrave runes into objects, their own bodies, or magical circles, allowing them to store, enhance, and reshape magic.

This class is very advanced and not recommended for beginners.

Magic and Runes

Unlike traditional spellcasters, Runemasters do not cast spells instantly. Instead, they inscribe runes into objects, the environment, or themselves to store magic for later use.

- Cantrips & Spells: Start with 3 cantrips, 2 first-level spells, and 1 second-level spell.
    
- Rune Proficiency: You may add your Arcana skill modifier to all rune effectiveness rolls.
    
- Rune Circles:
    

- Each rune circle requires at least 5 runes, with 3 being carbon runes (base energy carriers).
    
- Must have at least 1 more carbon rune than all other types combined.
    
- Link runes are exempt from carbon requirements.
    
- A GM determines the exact effect of each circle based on rune combinations.
    
- Creating a rune circle takes a long rest.
    

Elemental Affinity

At Level 1, choose one affinity from the list below. You gain +5 points in that Affinity, which should be recorded on your character sheet. This bonus reflects your early attunement to a particular magical domain and improves your effectiveness with related runes and magic.

Below is a general overview of what each affinity enhances:

- Crafting - Enhances the creation of runic weapons, armor, and magical objects.
    
- Fire - Increases potency and control of offensive fire runes.
    
- Earth - Improves durability and defense-oriented runes.
    
- Water - Supports adaptability, fluid casting, and reactive effects.
    
- Air - Boosts mobility, initiative, and speed-related runes.
    
- Utility - Empowers general-purpose or non-combat runes.
    
- Physical - Enhances melee augmentation and movement-based runes.
    
- Creation - Aids in shaping, duplicating, or manifesting new rune forms.
    

Note: You gain +5 points to a single affinity from this list, not to all of them and you CANNOT choose Generic as your elemental affinity.
