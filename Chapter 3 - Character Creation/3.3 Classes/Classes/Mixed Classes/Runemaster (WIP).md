The Runemaster is a specialized spellcaster who manipulates the power of runes to craft magic in unique ways. Rather than simply casting spells like a traditional mage, they engrave runes into objects, their own bodies, or magical circles, allowing them to store, enhance, and reshape magic.

This class is very advanced and not recommended for beginners.

#### Magic and Runes
Unlike traditional spellcasters, Runemasters do not cast spells instantly. Instead, they inscribe runes into objects, the environment, or themselves to store magic for later use.
- Rune Proficiency: You may add your Arcana skill modifier to all rune effectiveness rolls.
- Rune Circles:
	- Each rune circle requires at least 5 runes, with 3 being carbon runes (base energy carriers).
	- Must have at least 1 more carbon rune than all other types combined.
	- Link runes are exempt from carbon requirements.
	- A GM determines the exact effect of each circle based on rune combinations.
	- Creating a rune circle takes a long rest.
#### Elemental Affinity
At Level 1, choose one affinity from the list below. You gain +5 points in that Affinity, which should be recorded on your character sheet. This bonus reflects your early attunement to a particular magical domain and improves your effectiveness with related runes and magic.
Below is a general overview of what each affinity enhances:
- Crafting - Enhances the creation of runic weapons, armor, and magical objects.
- Fire - Increases potency and control of offensive fire runes.
- Earth - Improves durability and defense-oriented runes.
- Water - Supports adaptability, fluid casting, and reactive effects.
- Air - Boosts mobility, initiative, and speed-related runes.
- Utility - Empowers general-purpose or non-combat runes.
- Physical - Enhances melee augmentation and movement-based runes.
- Creation - Aids in shaping, duplicating, or manifesting new rune forms.

Note: You gain +5 points to a single affinity from this list, not to all of them and you CANNOT choose Generic as your elemental affinity. 
#### Subclasses (Choose 1 at level 3)
##### Augmenter
Augmenters tattoo runes onto their own bodies, using them to boost physical abilities.
- Rune Infusion: Gain +1d4 to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for 1 minute (costs 1 mana).
- Arcane Resilience: While an active rune is inscribed on your body, reduce damage taken by 1d4.
##### Enchanter
Enchanters engrave runes into weapons, armor, or objects, enhancing their magical properties.
- Runic Weapon: Imbue a weapon with +1d6 elemental (Fire, earth, water, or Air) damage.
- Protective Wards: Rune-engraved armor grants +2 AC or resistance to one element (Fire, earth, water, air). This effect applies on top of any other rune engravings but only applies if you pass a arcana check (DC 10). On a failed check the wards will not inscribe. 
- Runic Overload (costs 1 mana): Double an enchanted weapon’s damage for 1 minute, but risk breaking the weapon permanently (roll a d20, if the result is below 14 the weapon is now broken).
##### Trapper
Trappers create rune circles that trigger delayed effects based on proximity, time, or triggers.
- Trapmaster’s Sigil: You can prepare up to 3 rune traps before needing a long rest, these traps have the effect of a single rune and cost 1 mana to place, they can be created as a bonus action.
- Delayed Activation: Choose a trigger for rune circles (footsteps, sound, movement, time delay). This will mean the rune traps will activate without the user’s consent or effort at no cost. 
- Trapper Knowledge: When one of your rune traps activates within 1 mile of yourself you know that it has activated and is now consumed. 
##### Rune Slinger
Rune Slingers hurl physical runes or use them to enhance spell attacks.
- Runic Projectile: Throw a rune up to 30 ft, the rune will activate when it comes in contact with something. 
- Arcane Amplification: When using a rune you may consume mana to increase effectiveness (10 mana is +1 to the rune effect).
