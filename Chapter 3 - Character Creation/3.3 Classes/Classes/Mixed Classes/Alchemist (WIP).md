Alchemical Crafting - Science Over Magic

Alchemists do not cast traditional spells. Instead, they brew and craft chemical concoctions, which must be prepared in advance.

- Formula Preparation: Each long rest, an Alchemist can prepare up to 3 formulas, increasing by +1 per level.
    
- Experimental Mixtures: Alchemists can attempt to create new effects by combining multiple concoctions, requiring an Intelligence check (DC 10 + complexity level).

Chaos Alchemist

(Prerequisite: At least 1 level in another magical class)  
Chaos Alchemists blend alchemy with arcane magic, leading to unpredictable and often volatile results.

- 1-2: Effect is weaker (-1d6 damage/healing).
    
- 3-4: Effect functions normally.
    
- 5-6: Effect is enhanced (+1d6 damage/healing).
    

- Arcane Catalyst: Once per long rest, you can combine a potion with a spell, altering its properties. (GM determines the outcome.)
    
- Wild Transmutation (1/Long Rest): Create a potion that forces the drinker to randomly transform (GM’s choice of beneficial or chaotic effects).
