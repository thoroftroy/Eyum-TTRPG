Alchemists are scientists and tinkerers who harness the power of chemistry and experimentation to create potions, explosives, and mutagens. Unlike traditional spellcasters, Alchemists do not use magic, instead relying on chemical reactions, compounds, and formulas to achieve supernatural results.

This class is very advanced and not recommended for beginners. 

- Weapons: Daggers, Bows, Spears
- Armor: Light Armor
- Saving Throws: Intelligence, Dexterity
- Proficiency Bonus: Starts at +2, increases every 3 levels
- Proficiency with Light Armor

Hit Dice: 2d4  
Vitality Dice: 3d4  
Mana Dice: 1d4

#### Alchemical Crafting - Science Over Magic
Alchemists do not cast traditional spells. Instead, they brew and craft chemical concoctions, which must be prepared in advance.
- Formula Preparation: Each long rest, an Alchemist can prepare up to 3 formulas, increasing by +1 per level.
- Experimental Mixtures: Alchemists can attempt to create new effects by combining multiple concoctions, requiring an Intelligence check (DC 10 + complexity level).

#### Subclasses (Choose 1 at level 3)
##### Demolitionist 
Demolitionists focus on bomb-making, using their knowledge to create explosive and concussive effects.
- Bomb Making: Gain the ability to craft explosive grenades that deal 2d6 fire damage in a 10 ft radius (increases by 1d6 every 3 levels).
- Concussive Shockwave: Bombs can push enemies back 10 ft on a failed Strength save (DC 10 + Intelligence Modifier).
- Sticky Compound (1/Short Rest): Create an adhesive bomb, forcing creatures in a 10 ft area to make a Dexterity save or become restrained for 1 minute.
##### Herbalist
Herbalists manipulate organic compounds, specializing in healing elixirs and deadly toxins.
- Toxin Specialist: You can coat weapons with poison, forcing enemies to make a Constitution save or suffer 1d8 poison damage for 3 rounds.
- Healing Draught: Once per short rest, create a healing potion that restores 2d6 HP (increases by 1d6 every 3 levels).
- Paralytic Venom (1/Long Rest): Brew a poison that forces an enemy to make a Constitution save (DC 10 + Intelligence Modifier) or become paralyzed for 1 minute.
##### Chaos Alchemist
(Prerequisite: At least 1 level in another magical class)  
Chaos Alchemists blend alchemy with arcane magic, leading to unpredictable and often volatile results.
- Unstable Mixtures: Whenever you create a concoction, roll a 1d6:
- 1-2: Effect is weaker (-1d6 damage/healing).
- 3-4: Effect functions normally.
- 5-6: Effect is enhanced (+1d6 damage/healing).
- Arcane Catalyst: Once per long rest, you can combine a potion with a spell, altering its properties. (GM determines the outcome.)
- Wild Transmutation (1/Long Rest): Create a potion that forces the drinker to randomly transform (GM’s choice of beneficial or chaotic effects).
