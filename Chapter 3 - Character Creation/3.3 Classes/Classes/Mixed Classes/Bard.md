Magical Gain - Song Magic

Bards cast spells through performance, whether through singing, playing instruments, or spoken word.

- Spellcasting Focus: A musical instrument must be in hand to cast spells.
    
- Magical Improvisation: Once per long rest, you may attempt to replicate a spell you have witnessed in the past hour, even if it is not on your known spell list. To do so, make a Performance check with a DC of 15 + half the spell’s mana cost (rounded up).
    

- On a success, you may cast the spell once, after which you must see someone else cast the spell again to make another attempt.
    
- On a failure, you lose the ability to attempt or cast that spell again until after your next long rest and seeing it performed again.
    
- After five successful castings (and successful checks) of the same spell, you may permanently learn that spell. This count will reset on a long rest.
    
- You may know a maximum of 3 × Bard level spells through Magical Improvisation.
    
- Spells learned this way are permanent and cannot be unlearned.
    

- Bardic Inspiration: You can grant 1d6 inspiration to an ally, adding it to their attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. (You get 1 use of bardic inspiration per level).
