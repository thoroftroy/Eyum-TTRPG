#### Magical Gain - Song Magic
Bards cast spells through performance, whether through singing, playing instruments, or spoken word.
- Spellcasting Focus: A musical instrument must be in hand to cast spells.
- Magical Improvisation: Once per long rest, you may attempt to replicate a spell you have witnessed in the past hour, even if it is not on your known spell list. To do so, make a Performance check with a DC of 10 + half the spell’s mana cost (rounded up).
	- On a success, you may cast the spell once, after which you must see someone else cast the spell again to make another attempt.
	- On a failure, you lose the ability to attempt or cast that spell again until after your next long rest and seeing it performed again.
	- After five successful castings (and successful checks) of the same spell, you may permanently learn that spell. This count will reset on a long rest.
	- You may know a maximum of 3 × Bard level spells through Magical Improvisation.
	- Spells learned this way are permanent and cannot be unlearned.
- Bardic Inspiration: You can grant 1d6 inspiration to an ally, adding it to their attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. (You get 1 use of bardic inspiration per level).
#### Subclasses (Choose 1 at level 3)
##### Survivalist
Survivalists prioritize their own survival, using music to boost their stamina, evasion, and durability.
- Battle Ballad: Gain +2 AC and advantage on Dexterity saving throws while performing.
- Resilient Tune: Gain 1d8 Vitality after casting a spell.
- Lone Survivor (1/Long Rest): When reduced to 0 HP, stay at 1 HP instead.
- Bardic Resilience (Passive): Your Vitality Dice goes from a 1d8 to a 1d12 for every bard level after this one.
##### Jack of All Trades
A Jack of All Trades excels at everything, offering moderate proficiency in combat, magic, and skills.
- Versatile Performer: Gain +2 to all skill checks.
- Quick Learner (1/Long Rest): For 5 turns, add Bardic Inspiration to all rolls.
##### Gambler
Gamblers thrive on deception, persuasion, and money, turning wealth into powerful magic boosts.
- High Stakes: Spend gold pieces to increase a spell’s power:
	- 5g = +1d8 damage/healing
	- 10g = Advantage on the spell’s attack roll
	- 15g = Roll twice for spell damage/healing, take the better result
- Silver Tongue: Gain expertise on Persuasion and Deception checks.
- Double or Nothing: Reroll a failed throw or roll but the DC to succeed is increased by 2. If you fail the roll again then suffer double the consequences. This skill may be used on any roll or save up to 3 times, each time increasing the DC and doubling the negative consequences. If you use this skill and fail on a check that normally would not have had negative consequences, it will now. 
##### Muse
Muses dedicate themselves to empowering allies, ensuring their party thrives.
- Harmonic Resonance: Allies within 30 ft gain +1 to attack and damage rolls when you perform.
- Bolstering Aria: When casting healing spells, add Bardic Inspiration die to the healed amount.
- Crescendo (1/Long Rest): Grant all allies Vitality equal to your Bard level + Charisma Modifier.
