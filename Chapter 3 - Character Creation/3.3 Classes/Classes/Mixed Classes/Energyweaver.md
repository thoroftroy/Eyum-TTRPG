Everything has an equal and opposite reaction. Everything is energy. Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
#### Level 1 Feature – Energy Conversion
You can convert any energy type you **know** into any other energy type you **know**.
- **Known Types.** You know an energy type if you have ≥1 **Subclass Level (SL)** in its subclass.
- **Throughput (Transfer Cap).** Each Energymancy casting may move up to **TP = your current Mana** (no cost; this is throughput only). If current Mana is 0, you cannot move energy.
- **Basic Transfer (default action).** (see [[6.1.6 Energymancy]] for more specifics)
    - **Action;** choose 1 known energy type as **the effect**.
    - **Declare Source → Target (+ Sink)**.
    - **Range & Media** are set by your SL and the energy’s media rules.
    - **Unwilling creatures:** use the attack/save.
    - **Effect size:** per-type baselines in 6.1.6; spells will override with specialties.
- **Cross-Type Conversion.** Converting A→B requires **SL 1 in A** and **SL 1 in B**. You may chain steps in one casting if the total TP moved ≤ your Transfer Cap.
- **Vitalic Conversions.** If **Vitalic** is known, you may convert TP into **+1 Vitality**, **+1 Health**, or **+1 Mana** per TP (never over maximums). You may also designate **your own current Mana** as a **Source** for any Energymancy transfer; each TP spent this way reduces your current Mana by 1.
#### Subclasses (choose 1 at level 1; +1 SL each Energyweaver level, max SL 5 per subclass)
Energymancy uses **only** the relevant Subclass Affinity (equal to SL). **Generic Affinity does not apply** to Energymancy.

> **Attack/Save defaults (used unless a spell says otherwise):**  
> Spell Attack = INT mod + Proficiency + relevant Subclass Affinity.  
> Save DC = 10 + INT mod + Proficiency + relevant Subclass Affinity.
##### Thermal (hot/cold)
Cold is the absence of heat, you move **heat** in or out; 
- **Scope.** Heat extraction/injection, temperature equalization, phase change (melt/freeze), ignition/quench.
- **Media & Range by SL (Thermal).**
    - **SL 1:** Touch **both** Source and Target.
    - **SL 2:** Conduct via **metal** up to **10 ft** (continuous piece); you must still touch at least one end.
    - **SL 3:** Conduct via **metal or water** up to **30 ft**; up to **1 joint** (e.g., metal bar → water tank).
    - **SL 4:** Conduct via **metal/water/stone** up to **60 ft**; up to **2 joints**.
    - **SL 5:** Conduct via **metal/water/stone/wood/earth** up to **120 ft**; up to **3 joints**. **Air does not conduct Thermal** by default; only specific spells can bridge air.
- **Notes.** Heating must be sourced; cooling must be sunk. Rapid phase change can fracture materials.
##### Kinetic (motion)
Speed things up, slow things down, or redirect impact.
- **Scope.** Acceleration, deceleration, redirection of impacts, arresting falls.
- **Mechanical Coupling.** **Requires a rigid contact path** (body, weapon, pole, wall, floor, chain, etc.). You cannot conduct kinetic transfers through air or flexible slack lines.
- **Media & Range by SL (Kinetic).**
    - **SL 1:** Touch **both** Source and Target (your body is a valid rigid path).
    - **SL 2:** Rigid path up to **10 ft** (e.g., spear haft, crowbar, tight chain); **0 joints** (one continuous piece).
    - **SL 3:** Rigid path up to **30 ft**; **1 mechanical joint** (hinge, coupling, tight knotted rope under tension).
    - **SL 4:** Rigid path up to **60 ft**; **2 joints**.
    - **SL 5:** Rigid path up to **120 ft**; **3 joints**.
- **Notes.** You must name where removed momentum goes (ground, bracing, enemy, etc.).
##### Chemical (stored energy)
Store energy in things, then release it.
- **Scope.** **Buffering** (store) and **release** (dump) of arbitrary energy as **stored potential** in physical objects.
- **Storage Capacity.** An object can only store so much energy in it. For more information see [[6.1.6 Energymancy]].
##### Gravitational (mass/attraction/telekinesis)
Slow/stop speeding mass, speed it up, reverse it, or link bodies so they attract.
- **Scope.** Falling/launch energy control, telekinetic translation, local attraction links, compression loading.
- **Mass Limits by SL (single target at a time).**
    - **SL 1:** up to **100 lb**
    - **SL 2:** up to **300 lb**
    - **SL 3:** up to **600 lb**
    - **SL 4:** up to **1,200 lb**
    - **SL 5:** up to **2,400 lb**
- **Range & Anchors.** Gravitational effects don’t need a conduction medium, but they **must be anchored** to a point you can see.
    - **SL 1:** Touch to anchor; 0 ft range.
    - **SL 2:** **10 ft** anchor range.
    - **SL 3:** **30 ft** anchor range.
    - **SL 4:** **60 ft** anchor range.
    - **SL 5:** **120 ft** anchor range.
- **Linking.** You may declare two touched objects “linked” (count as mutual Targets) within your anchor range; pull strength scales with TP and is adjudicated by mass limits above.
##### Sonic (vibration)
Make things louder or quieter; vibration breaks stuff; silence stops verbal casting.
- **Scope.** Damping, amplification, resonance/shatter, echolocation; speech/footfall suppression.
- **Medium.** **Requires a material medium** (air/water/solid). Barriers block like real sound.
- **Media & Range by SL (Sonic).**
    - **SL 1:** Touch both Source and Target (e.g., hand on wall/armor/throat).
    - **SL 2:** Through **air or water** up to **10 ft** in a straight line.
    - **SL 3:** **30 ft**; may bend once around a doorway/open hall.
    - **SL 4:** **60 ft**; up to two bends; moderate wall attenuations (thin wood) allowed.
    - **SL 5:** **120 ft**; up to three bends; heavy walls attenuate or block (stone/metal) unless the spell says otherwise.
##### Electromagnetic (electricity/light/fields)
Shock, arc, magnetize; bend light to blind or darken; hijack nerve signals.
- **Scope.** Charge flow/arcing, magnetism, nerve interference, refraction/illumination.
- **Electric Conduction Rules.** Electricity favors the **lowest resistance path**.
    - **Path Difficulty (PD):** Metal 0, Brine 1, Fresh Water 2, Flesh 3, Wet Wood 3, Dry Wood 4, Stone 5, Air 6.
    - You can conduct only if **SL ≥ PD**. If multiple paths exist, the current uses the **lowest PD** unless a spell explicitly forces otherwise.
- **Light Rules.** Light uses **line of sight** and ignores the PD table. Mirrors/prisms can redirect per spell text.
- **Media & Range by SL (EM).**
    - **SL 1:** Touch both Source and Target.
    - **SL 2:** Up to **10 ft** via PD 0 (metal) or **LoS 10 ft** for light.
    - **SL 3:** **30 ft** via PD ≤2, or **LoS 30 ft** for light.
    - **SL 4:** **60 ft** via PD ≤4, or **LoS 60 ft** for light; magnetism works through ferromagnets in path.
    - **SL 5:** **120 ft** via PD ≤6 (including **air**), or **LoS 120 ft** for light.
- **Nerves.** Treat living tissue as **PD 3**; unwilling targets get the usual attack/save.
##### Vitalic (Bio)
Convert other energies into healing/support, and you can use **your Mana as an actual energy source** (not only a cap).
- **Scope.** Vitality/Health/Mana transfers to living targets; healing/empowerment via conversions.
- **Range by SL (Vitalic).**
    - **SL 1:** Touch.
    - **SL 2:** **5 ft** through a **living contact chain** (e.g., ally hand on ally).
    - **SL 3:** **15 ft** line of sight to a living target.
    - **SL 4:** **30 ft** line of sight.
    - **SL 5:** **60 ft** line of sight.
- **Mana as Source.** You may designate your **current Mana** as Source for any Energymancy effect at **1 TP per 1 current Mana** spent (this reduces your current Mana).
#### Leveling Table
Affinity Points gained from Energyweaver levels cannot be spent in non-Energyweaver affinities. **Each Energyweaver level grants +1 Subclass Level** (allocate to an existing or new subclass; max SL 5 per subclass).
