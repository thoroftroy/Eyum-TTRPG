### Core Mechanics
**Energymancy**  
You do not learn or cast spells. Instead, you gain access to Energymancy Actions. These actions manipulate Mana, Vitality, and Hit Points directly and are not considered spells for any purpose. As you level up you will gain actions, see [[6.1.4 Energymancy]] for more information. 

**Energy Types**  
Energymancy interacts with the following energy pools:
- Hit Points (HP): life force and survival
- Vitality: physical and biological energy
- Mana: magical and arcane energy

**Energy Conversion**  
You may convert energy using the following ratios. These conversions work in either direction.
- 3 Mana ⇄ 1 Vitality
- 3 Vitality ⇄ 1 Hit Point

Conversions may target yourself or another creature if an Energymancy Action allows it.

**Excess Energy**  
Mana, Vitality, and HP cannot exceed their maximum values.  
If Mana or Vitality would exceed its maximum, total the excess, divide by 3 (rounding up), and take that amount as true damage directly to HP.  
This rule applies to all creatures and may be intentionally triggered to overload a target.

**Energymancy Actions Known**  
You begin play knowing **Convert Energy**.  
You learn additional Energymancy Actions as you gain Energyweaver levels, as listed in the Energymancy Actions section.
### Subclasses
Choose one subclass at level 3.

**Life**  
You may use HP as a valid source or destination for standard Energymancy actions alongside Mana and Vitality. Standard conversions apply (3 Vitality = 1 HP).

**Heat**  
You gain resistance to fire and heat-based damage.

**Kinetic**  
Your vitality die changed from 1d10 to 1d12 + 1d6.

**Magic**  
You may modify standard conversion ratios, treating 1 Mana as equivalent to 6 Vitality instead of 3.
