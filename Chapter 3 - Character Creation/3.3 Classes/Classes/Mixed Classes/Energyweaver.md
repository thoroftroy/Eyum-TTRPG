### Core Mechanics
**Energymancy**  
You do not learn or cast spells. Instead, you gain access to Energymancy Actions. These actions manipulate Mana, Vitality, and Hit Points directly and are not considered spells for any purpose. As you level up you will gain actions, see [[6.1.4 Energymancy]] for more information. 

**Energy Types**  
Energymancy interacts with the following energy pools:
- Hit Points (HP): life force and survival
- Vitality: physical and biological energy
- Mana: magical and arcane energy

**Energy Conversion**  
You may convert energy using the following ratios. These conversions work in either direction.
- 3 Mana ⇄ 1 Vitality
- 3 Vitality ⇄ 1 Hit Point

Conversions may target yourself or another creature if an Energymancy Action allows it.

**Excess Energy**  
Mana, Vitality, and HP cannot exceed their maximum values.  
If Mana or Vitality would exceed its maximum, total the excess, divide by 3 (rounding up), and take that amount as true damage directly to HP.  
This rule applies to all creatures and may be intentionally triggered to overload a target.

**Energymancy Actions Known**  
You begin play knowing **Convert Energy**.  
You learn additional Energymancy Actions as you gain Energyweaver levels, as listed in the Energymancy Actions section.
### Subclasses
Choose one subclass at level 3.

**Life**  
You may treat **HP** as a valid **source or destination** for standard Energymancy actions, alongside **Mana** and **Vitality**.
- Standard conversion ratios apply (**3 Vitality = 1 HP**).
- You **cannot** transfer Mana directly to HP or HP directly to Mana.
- Moving energy between Mana and HP requires **two separate Convert Energy actions** (via Vitality).

**Heat**  
You gain **resistance** to **fire and heat-based damage**, **+5 Fire Affinity** and all **fire-based attack rolls** deal **+1d4 fire damage** at the **cost of 1 Mana** per attack (optional).

**Kinetic**  
Your **Vitality die** changes from **1d10** to **1d12 + 1d6** and you may use **Convert Energy** as a **bonus action**.

**Magic**  
_Requires at least one level in a magical class._  
You may alter the standard Mana ↔ Vitality conversion ratios:
- **1 Vitality → 6 Mana**
- **3 Mana → 2 Vitality**
- Conversions must be performed at these values or greater; partial or smaller conversions are not allowed.
