Energyweavers are thermodynamic manipulators who do not rely on mana or traditional spells. Instead, they manipulate real-world energy types, heat, motion, electricity, and sound, using scientific principles. Their magic is defined by how much energy they can transfer at once and how precisely they redirect that energy in or out of objects. All effects must obey physical laws: energy must come from a source and must go somewhere else.

This class is very advanced and not recommended for beginners. 
- Weapons: Tools, Unarmed, Light Weapons
- Armor: None
- Spellcasting Modifier: Intelligence
- Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom
- Proficiency Bonus: +2 (increases by 1 every 3 levels)
- Hit Dice: 1d6
- Vitality Dice: 1d12
- Mana Dice: 1d4
- Proficiency with Light-Medium Armor
#### Core Mechanics
- Joule Limit = 10 × Energyweaver Level  
    This is the maximum energy (in Joules) the Energyweaver can manipulate in a single turn. 
- Energy Source and Reaction Requirement  
    All energy castings must have:
- A Source (heat from fire, motion from falling object, internal vitality, etc.)
- A Target (enemy, object, environment)
- A Reaction (energy moves into the caster, the ground, a different object, etc.)
- Direct Vitality Conversion  
    If using personal vitality as a source, the conversion is:  
    1 Vitality = 3 Joules  
    If the caster is at 0 Vitality, they may take 3 HP damage per 3 Joules instead.
- Transfer Rolls  
    Roll 1d20 + relevant Energy Affinity  
    Used to affect unwilling targets, resist objects’ inertia, or hit with damage.
- Distance Penalty  
    -2 per 5 ft from self beyond the first 5 ft.  
    This penalty is reduced by 1 for every +3 in the relevant Affinity.
#### Energy Affinities
These replace traditional spell lists and define what kinds of forces the Energyweaver can manipulate. Energyweavers begin with -5 in each and gain 10 points to distribute at level 1 (when leveling up you may use affinity points to raise these affinities).

These replace normal Affinities and are exclusive to this class.
- Thermal - Heat and cold energy
- Kinetic - Speed, acceleration, momentum
- Electromagnetic - Light, magnetism, electric fields
#### Level 1 Features
- Energy Transfer (Core Mechanic)  
    You may transfer energy between valid sources and targets. All actions must obey physics. Damage scales with Joules moved. You may redirect energy into yourself or your environment if needed.
- Joule Scaling (Combat Damage)  
    Every 5 Joules = 1d4 damage  
    e.g. 15 J = 3d4
- Known Energy Actions:  
    You begin with 1 known Energy Actions (see list below).
#### Energy Actions
###### Thermal Transfer
Effect: Move thermal energy (heat) into or out of an object or creature to cause burns, freezing, or temperature change.
Damage Equation:
- Damage Dice = (Joules ÷ 5), in d4s
- Example: 15 J = 3d4 fire or cold damage (depending on whether heat is added or removed)
Utility Equation:
- Temperature Change (in °C) = Joules ÷ Mass (in kg)
- Example: 100 J transferred into a 2 kg object = 50°C increase
Range: Starts at 0 ft. Increases with Thermal Affinity (see scaling).  
Max Targets per Turn: 1, unless otherwise stated by action or Affinity level.
Reaction Requirement: All thermal energy must be sourced and redirected. If heat is removed from a creature (dealing cold) and no target is declared, it enters the caster and deals 100% of the original damage (dealing fire). If heat is added and not sourced from somewhere, it must come from the caster, see Core Mechanics for more. 
Thermal Affinity Scaling:
- -5 or less: Range 0 ft. You must target yourself or a creature/object you are touching. You take 100% of the reaction damage.
- -4 to 0: Range 5 ft. You must redirect heat into yourself or an object in contact. You take 50% of the reaction if redirected.
- 1 to 4: Range 10 ft. You may redirect heat into inanimate objects within range. You no longer take some of the damage and may redirect all of it into another object.
- 5 to 9: Range 15 ft. You may redirect to ground or enemies.
- 10 or more: Range 20 ft. You may split heat between two targets, but must still declare where all energy goes.
- For every 5 additional affinity you may either increase the number of targets or the range by 10ft
Examples:
- Adding 25 J into a creature deals 5d4 fire damage and you must draw this from a torch, your own body (8 Vitality), or another heat source.
- Removing 10 J from a hot blade deals 2d4 cold damage and the heat must go into your body (5 J damage) or a nearby object this will make the blade no longer be hot.
###### Kinetic Transfer
Effect: Add or remove motion to or from a physical object or creature, causing acceleration, deceleration, or impact.
Damage Equation:
- Damage Dice = (Joules ÷ 10), in d6s
- Example: 30 J = 3d6 bludgeoning damage
Utility Equation:
- Velocity Change (in ft/s) = (Joules ÷ (2 × Mass in lbs)) × 1.355
- Example: 50 J applied to a 10 lb object = (50 ÷ 20) × 1.355 = 3.4 ft/s increase or decrease
Range: Starts at 0 ft. Increases with Kinetic Affinity.  
Max Targets per Turn: 1
Reaction Requirement: Motion must be sourced or redirected. Accelerating an object pulls energy from a source (falling object, your own movement, etc.). Decelerating an object pushes that force into the caster or another object. If not redirected it redirects into you and you take 1d6 damage per 25 J of unreleased force and are thrown backward.
Kinetic Affinity Scaling:
- -5 or less: Range 0 ft. You must target yourself or a creature/object you are touching. You take 100% of the reaction force.
- -4 to 0: Range 5 ft. You may direct reaction into yourself or a nearby object. 50% of force hits you and the rest hits an object you are nearby.
- 1 to 4: Range 10 ft. May redirect to the ground or large structures. You no longer have to absorb some energy into yourself.
- 5 to 9: Range 15 ft. May redirect into the enemy. Gain +5 ft knockback to affected target.
- 10 or more: Range 20 ft. May split acceleration between targets. Must still declare a recoil direction.
- For every 5 additional affinity you may either increase the number of targets or the range by 10ft
Examples:
- You slow a falling 180 lb creature using 100 J, preventing fall damage. That kinetic energy is redirected into a stone platform, which cracks under strain.
- You throw a 10 lb object by applying 30 J. It deals 3d6 on impact. If energy is drawn from yourself, you’re knocked backward unless redirected.
###### Electromagnetic Transfer
Effect: Control electrical charge, visible light, or magnetism to shock enemies, blind them, or manipulate metal.
Damage Equation:
- Damage Dice = (Joules ÷ 7), in d6s
- Example: 21 J = 3d6 lightning damage
Utility Effects:
- Light or Darkness Radius = Joules ÷ 2 (in feet)
- Flash Save = DC 10 + Electromagnetic Affinity
- Muscle Lock (Paralysis): Use 50+ J, target makes CON Save DC 14 or loses next action
Range: Starts at 0 ft. Increases with Electromagnetic Affinity.  
Max Targets per Turn: 2
Reaction Requirement: Charge must flow. Absorbed electricity must be grounded, redirected into another object, or released. If no target is declared the reaction happens to you and you take 1d6 damage per 25 J due to internal arcing.
Electromagnetic Affinity Scaling:
- -5 or less: Range 0 ft. Must target self or a creature/object you are touching. Take 100% internal damage from any effect used.
- -4 to 0: Range 5 ft. May redirect charge into nearby metal object. 50% of reaction must go into you.
- 1 to 4: Range 10 ft. Redirect into conductors (metal weapons, armor). Blind on flash requires Save. All reaction may be placed into metal objects.
- 5 to 9: Range 15 ft. May arc electricity to a second target. You may now send reaction into the ground.
- 10 or more: Range 20 ft. May arc electricity to an additional target
- For every 5 additional affinity you may either increase the number of targets or the range by 10ft
Examples:
- Using 14 J to shock a creature deals 2d6 lightning damage. The charge is sourced from a battery or your own vitality (5 Vitality = 15 J).
- You create a 10 ft flash using 10 J. Targets in the radius must pass a DC 14 CON Save or be blinded (EnergyweaverLvl turns).
