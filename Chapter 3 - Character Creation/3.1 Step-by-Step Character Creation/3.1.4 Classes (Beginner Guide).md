Choosing a class determines how your character fights, casts spells, survives danger, and interacts with the world. Each class has its own strengths, limitations, and play-style.

Below is a chart that compares the major traits of each class, followed by descriptions of what each class does and how difficult it is to play.

**Note on Multiclass Score**: This value reflects how well a class performs when combined with other classes. Higher numbers indicate greater flexibility and synergy, the class contributes useful features, stats, or abilities regardless of what you pair it with. Lower numbers mean the class is more self-contained, offering less benefit when split across multiple class paths.

**Note on Difficulty to Use**: This value reflects how complex or demanding a class is. Higher numbers mean easier to play (more forgiving or straightforward), while lower numbers (especially negative values) indicate classes that are more difficult to master due to mechanics, resource tracking, or situational reliance.

**Note on Overall Score**: The Overall Score is a general measure of how many areas a class performs well in, not a direct indicator of total power. Some high-scoring classes, like the Bard, excel in versatility and support, but may struggle in direct combat. Others, like the Monk, may have a lower overall score but dominate in specific roles, such as lots of attacks during combat. Always choose a class based on the play-style you enjoy, not just the numbers.

#### Melee Classes
##### Fighter  
Fighters are weapon specialists who focus on martial combat and raw reliability. They're one of the simplest classes to play, gaining steady increases to damage and accuracy with every level. Fighters don't use spells or flashy powers, they just hit hard, wear solid armor, and get better at doing both over time. This makes them an excellent beginner class for players who want to focus purely on combat without worrying about resources or complicated mechanics. However, Fighters can lack flexibility compared to more advanced classes and don’t scale as explosively into the late game.
##### Barbarian  
Barbarians are built to survive. They have the highest vitality scaling of any class and can reduce all incoming damage while raging. Although their accuracy isn't the highest, they’re excellent at staying in the front lines and drawing aggro. Barbarians can’t use ranged weapons, and they don’t get any magical abilities, so they rely entirely on brute force and toughness. They're easy to play and hard to kill, making them ideal for players who want to charge into battle and take hits that would drop any other character.
##### Monk  
Monks are unarmored martial artists who fight with fists and inner energy called Ki. They scale rapidly in mobility, speed, and action economy, becoming one of the most mechanically dynamic melee classes. A Monk can't be disarmed, gets powerful subclass techniques, and eventually becomes faster and more accurate than nearly anyone else. That said, Monks are more complex than Fighters or Barbarians, and require thoughtful resource management and positioning to shine. They also don't generally use standard weapons, so you miss out on cool magical items. They're great for players who want a mix of martial power and battlefield mobility.
#### Ranged Classes
##### Rogue  
Rogues are agile, cunning combatants who deal high damage by exploiting enemy weaknesses through Sneak Attack. They are most effective when paired with allies or positioned strategically to ambush or outmaneuver opponents. Rogues excel at stealth, traps, and skill checks, but they are fragile and rely on positioning and reactions to avoid danger. Their toolkit is extremely powerful but slightly more complex than other martial classes, so they’re a great fit for players who like tactical thinking and creative problem-solving.
##### Ranger  
Rangers are long-ranged specialists who use bows and terrain familiarity to eliminate enemies from a distance. They are the most straightforward ranged classes, with strong accuracy and consistent damage over time. Rangers don’t have many flashy abilities, but they’re easy to learn and reliable in nearly every situation. This is a great pick for players who want a simple but effective “sniper” archetype.
#### Spellcasting Classes
##### Cleric  
Clerics are divine spellcasters who draw power from a god and specialize in healing, buffs, and radiant magic. They are the only class capable of reviving the dead without items, making them essential in high-risk campaigns. Clerics scale well with affinity, mana, and action economy, and their subclass (called a domain) determines their magical focus. However, Clerics must uphold their chosen god’s ideals to keep their powers, which can restrict choices in roleplay or tactics. They are best for players who want to protect their allies, heal effectively, and follow a divine path.
##### Warlock  
Warlocks gain magic by forming a pact with a powerful entity, often a god, demon, or ancient monster. They excel in damage, curses, and utility magic. Each Warlock entity (called a patron) drastically changes how the class plays, offering abilities like transformation, necromancy, or battlefield control. Warlocks scale well and are highly flexible, but their powers are tied to the patron they serve, which can lead to consequences if the pact is broken. They’re great for players who enjoy roleplaying powerful but morally complicated characters with heavy-hitting magic.
##### Wizard  
Wizards are the most versatile and efficient spellcasters in the game. They learn more spells than any other class and can control nearly any situation with AoEs, illusions, teleports, or force spells. Wizards scale fast in mana and spell variety, but they are physically weak and have fewer defenses than other classes. Smart positioning and spell selection are crucial. This is the perfect class for players who want deep spell lists, high adaptability, and a “glass cannon” play-style.
##### Sorcerer  
Sorcerers are born with innate magical power, unleashing devastating spells powered by raw force. They get fewer spells than other casters but make up for it with higher spell damage and unique effects. Sorcerers are especially strong at low levels but burn through mana quickly and struggle with long fights unless carefully managed. They're best suited for players who want to deal huge damage quickly and don’t mind being a bit fragile or limited in sustained casting.
##### Druid  
Druids are spellcasters tied to nature, capable of healing, controlling terrain, summoning weather, and even shape-shifting into animals. They’re versatile and flavorful, but their effectiveness depends on preparation and knowing which spells to pick. Druids have a major downside in that they cannot use their magic in a way that harms nature. Druids are ideal for players who want to shift between healing, support, and damage roles while embracing a nature theme.
#### Specialist Classes
##### Paladin  
Paladins are hybrid warrior-spellcasters bound by a personal oath. They can use melee weapons, cast healing or radiant spells, and even engage in ranged combat depending on build. Their biggest strength is versatility, they can fill any party role, but they never become the best at any single one. Their powers are tied to a moral or narrative Oath, and breaking that oath can lead to penalties and loss of power. Paladins are great for players who want flexibility and enjoy roleplaying a character with clear values and conviction.
##### Bard 
Bards are magical performers who use music, speech, and charm to support allies and manipulate enemies. Their spells focus on inspiration, crowd control, and utility, and they have some of the highest survivability among casters. Bards also get more skill points and social interaction tools than most classes, making them great outside of combat too. They are easy to play and very flexible, ideal for players who like helping the team, talking their way through problems, or being the group’s emotional core. Bards are the most skilled class, they are usually good at basically everything outside of combat, so skill checks will be your friend. 
##### Alchemist  
Alchemists are complex crafting-focused characters who create potions, bombs, and chemical mixtures instead of casting spells. They must plan ahead by preparing formulas during rests, which can heal allies, deal massive AoE damage, or cause debuffs and terrain effects. Alchemists have incredible potential, but they are not recommended for beginners due to their complexity and reliance on inventory and timing. This class is perfect for experienced players who enjoy prep-heavy, support/control roles with flexible utility.
##### Runemaster  
Runemasters inscribe magical runes to affect the battlefield, their gear, or themselves. Their spells take longer to set up than traditional magic, but can be extremely powerful when timed well. A Runemaster can alter terrain, empower attacks, or seal off entire areas. However, mastering runes takes planning and system knowledge, making them one of the hardest classes to play. Ideal for players who like long-term setup, creative combos, and playing the “chess-master” of the group.
##### Energyweaver  
Energyweavers are advanced casters who manipulate real-world energy, heat, motion, electricity, and more, using scientific principles instead of mana or spells. Every action must follow physics: energy must be sourced from somewhere and redirected into something else. Players choose from Energy Actions like Thermal Transfer or Kinetic Shock, using a pool of Joules to fuel effects each turn. Success depends on managing Energy Affinities, distance penalties, and physics-based reactions, which can backfire or damage the caster if handled incorrectly. This class is extremely powerful, but only in the hands of players who can think in physics, math, and momentum. It is not recommended for beginners, as each turn involves complex targeting and equation-based choices
