Characters interact with the world based on what they can see, and in Eyum, not everyone sees the same way. Some races thrive in pitch darkness; others need light to survive underground. This section explains how light and vision work in the game world.

Light Levels

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Light Level|Effect|
|Bright Light|Full visibility. Daylight, torches within 20 ft, glowing crystals, etc. No penalties.|
|Dim Light|Partial visibility. Shadows, twilight, or the edge of torchlight (20-40 ft). Attackers may gain concealment unless you have Low-Light or Darkvision.|
|Darkness|No natural visibility. Caves, night with no moon, deep dungeons. You cannot see without Darkvision, magic, or a light source.|

Types of Vision

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Type|Range|Description|
|Normal Vision|,|You see clearly in bright light and dimly in dim light. You cannot see in darkness without a light source.|
|Low-Light Vision|Double in dim light|You treat dim light as bright light for visibility. You still cannot see in complete darkness.|
|Darkvision|60 ft (default)|You can see in total darkness as if it were dim light, but only in shades of gray. You cannot discern color.|
|True Sight|Varies (rare)|You see everything as it truly is: invisible creatures, hidden illusions, ethereal forms, and magical darkness. Only obtained through magic or special abilities.|

Light Sources

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Source|Bright Light|Dim Light|
|Torch|20 ft|20 ft|
|Lantern|30 ft|30 ft|
|Light (spell)|30 ft|30 ft|
|Campfire|40 ft|40 ft|
|Glowcrystals|Varies (5-20 ft)|Same|

Notes:

- Torches burn for 1 hour. You can carry one in a free hand.
    
- Lanterns require oil and must be lit.
    
- Glowcrystals are stable, reusable, and favored by spelunkers.
    

Darkvision Rules

- Most underground, shadow-aligned, or nocturnal races have Darkvision (60 ft) by default. A few powerful creatures may have 120 ft.
    
- Darkvision does not pierce magical darkness. It also renders everything in grayscale, making color identification impossible.
    
- If you have Darkvision, you ignore darkness penalties within range.
    
- If you do not have it, you are effectively blind in total darkness.
    

Other Rules

- Stealth in Dim Light: Characters in dim light may gain +2 to Stealth checks if their opponents lack Low-Light or Darkvision.
    
- Darkness as Terrain: Total darkness may reduce movement speed unless the creature has precise movement methods, this reduction will generally be half but is up to the Game Master.
