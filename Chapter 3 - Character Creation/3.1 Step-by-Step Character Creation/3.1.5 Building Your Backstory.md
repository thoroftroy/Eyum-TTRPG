Your backstory helps define who your character is and why they do what they do. Instead of using premade traits or bonds, we just ask you to write your own backstory. The following questions don't all need to be answered, but answering them in your backstory will provide the GM with ample material to work you into the world and story. 

Questions
1. What mattered most to you before this journey?
	1. This could be a person, a belief, a goal, or a fear. What shaped you before the adventure began?
2. Why did you leave that behind?
	1. Whether by choice, force, or tragedy, what pushed you to change? Even if you're not ready to talk about it yet, your character knows.
3. What do you secretly hope for?
	1. Beneath the armor or attitude, what desire lingers? Redemption, glory, peace, revenge, love? You don’t have to admit it to the party. Ie what is your character’s motivation? 
4. Who (or what) would you die to protect?
	1. This can be someone real, a cause, a place, or even your own identity. It’s the line your character won’t cross or surrender.
5. What would truly break you?
	1. Not every character needs to be broken, but knowing what would ruin them adds depth. Is it failure, betrayal, loneliness, or something worse?

Tips for Writing
- Try to avoid perfect or flawless characters. Flaws aren’t bad, they give you room to grow.
- If your backstory is short, that’s fine. If it’s long, make sure your GM has time to read it (and is okay with spending the time to read it).
