Your backstory helps define who your character is and why they do what they do. Instead of using premade traits or bonds, this system asks a set of five focused prompts, each designed to anchor a meaningful part of your character's identity. You can answer them in a sentence or a page, and you can skip any you don’t like.

The Five Core Questions

1. What mattered most to you before this journey?
    

2. This could be a person, a belief, a goal, or a fear. What shaped you before the adventure began?
    

3. Why did you leave that behind?
    

4. Whether by choice, force, or tragedy, what pushed you to change? Even if you're not ready to talk about it yet, your character knows.
    

5. What do you secretly hope for?
    

6. Beneath the armor or attitude, what desire lingers? Redemption, glory, peace, revenge, love? You don’t have to admit it to the party. Ie what is your character’s motivation? 
    

7. Who (or what) would you die to protect?
    

8. This can be someone real, a cause, a place, or even your own identity. It’s the line your character won’t cross or surrender.
    

9. What would truly break you?
    

10. Not every character needs to be broken, but knowing what would ruin them adds depth. Is it failure, betrayal, loneliness, or something worse?
    

Tips for Writing

- Focus on emotions and consequences more than events.
    
- Use vagueness on purpose if you want to reveal things slowly. (Example: “I betrayed someone I loved” is enough, details can emerge in-game.)
    
- Try to avoid perfect or flawless characters. Flaws aren’t bad, they give you room to grow.
    
- If your backstory is short, that’s fine. If it’s long, make sure your GM has time to read it.
    

Optional Fields to Add to Your Character Sheet

These fields are helpful for GMs and can be placed in a separate backstory box:

- Known Associates (Family, mentors, rivals)
    
- Origin Location (Town, nation, temple, etc.)
    
- Current Secret(s) (Even if it never comes up)
    
- Story Hook (One or more unresolved things from your past)
