Alignment describes a characterâ€™s general worldview and moral tendencies. In Eyum, alignment is a guide to roleplaying, not a restriction on behavior. It helps the Game Master and other players understand how your character might respond to challenges, authority, and moral dilemmas.

Alignments are not absolute. A character may shift alignment over time based on their actions.

There are three main axes:

- Lawful - Values order, tradition, and systems of rules. May follow a personal code, government, religion, or cultural norms.
- Neutral - Balances between extremes or follows a situational ethic. Often prioritizes results over ideology.
- Chaotic - Favors freedom, individuality, and rebellion. Often distrusts institutions or seeks to disrupt them.

And:

- Good - Acts with compassion, seeks to help others, even at personal cost.
- Neutral - Acts with self-interest, balance, or pragmatism. Will help or harm depending on the situation.
- Evil - Acts for personal gain or pleasure, even if it harms others.

Combine the two to form alignments like Chaotic Good (a rebellious freedom fighter), Lawful Evil (a tyrannical overlord), or Neutral Neutral (a detached observer).

Your alignment should reflect how your character behaves, not just how they think. If you consistently act against your alignment, it should change to match your actions.
