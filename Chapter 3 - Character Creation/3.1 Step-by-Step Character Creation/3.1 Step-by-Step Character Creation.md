Note: This is one of the most important sections for players. Follow it step by step the first time you build a character, and don’t feel rushed. You can always tweak your character later with your GM’s approval.

When creating a character, the first step is to think about their story. It’s best to build characters around their backstory and how they will interact with the game master’s (GM) main narrative. Alternatively, you can focus on mechanics, such as spells, classes, and builds that you find fun to play. However, role-playing should always come first, as it brings your character to life.
##### Step 1: Basic Information
On your character sheet, fill out the following fields:
- Name: The name of your character.
- Background: See **Section 3.6 Background and Titles** (or worry about it later).
- Race: Choose from the race list in **Section 3.2**
- Class: Choose from the class list in **Section 3.3**
	- Usually a Campaign will start at level 1 but if your GM allows you to start at a higher level you may want to choose multiple classes for Multiclassing (See **Section 3.3.2 Multiclassing**)

If you are making your character's backstory first take note of the following as well;
- Age: Choose based on the typical lifespan of your race.
- Weight: Choose based on the average weight of your race.
- Height: Choose based on the average height of your race.
- Build: Describe your character’s physique (e.g., muscular, slender, overweight).
- Sex: What is your character’s biological sex?
- Alignment: See **Section 3.1.1 Alignment**

It is generally a good idea to have more detailed descriptions of your character’s physical traits and backstory written down separately in your notes. 
##### Step 2: Attributes
Next, locate the Attributes section (these are the boxes under the main information, currently we are looking at the Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma boxes).
- Each stat starts at 8 (-1) this is a bit below average of a normal human being, so a normal random guy would have an ~12 in all stats if he was perfectly average. 20 is the limit of regular humans, think of an Olympic athlete.
	- Note: If a stat goes below 1 at any point you die. 
- You are given **24** points to allocate as you see fit. You can remove points from one stat to add to another, but no stat can go below 4, this allows you to go below average on some stats but not so low you are dysfunctional.
- Point Costs:
	- Each point above 20 in a stat costs 2 points instead of 1.
	- Each point above 30 costs 3 points, and so on.

After allocating your points, apply any racial modifiers to your stats. For example, if your race grants +1 to Strength and your Strength is 22, set it to 22.5 (this will be rounded down for the modifier).
##### Calculating Modifiers
Subtract 10 from the ability score, then divide the result by 2 and round down. For example, a score of 15 gives a modifier of +2.
The modifiers here are for skill checks during play, so if you are supposed to make a skill check in Athletics and you have a +2 modifier then you roll 1d20 and add 2 to the result. 

Below is a chart for convince, however please note that stats can go above 30 and will follow the same pattern shown.  

| Ability Score | Modifier |
|---------------|----------|
| 1             | –5       |
| 2–3           | –4       |
| 4–5           | –3       |
| 6–7           | –2       |
| 8–9           | –1       |
| 10–11         | +0       |
| 12–13         | +1       |
| 14–15         | +2       |
| 16–17         | +3       |
| 18–19         | +4       |
| 20–21         | +5       |
| 22–23         | +6       |
| 24–25         | +7       |
| 26–27         | +8       |
| 28–29         | +9       |
| 30            | +10      |

##### Step 3: Affinity Chart
Affinities are for magic, simply just how good you are at specific types of magic. The average skill level of someone with any particular type of magic is a -5, however the skill each one starts at is determined by your race. 

Around the Attributes section, you’ll find the Affinity Chart (This includes the Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Creation, Physical, Craft, Utility, and Generic Boxes; Thermal, Genetic, and Electromagnetic can be ignored for now unless you have chosen the Energyweaver class (See **Section 3.3 In Mixed Classes**)).
- You are given 10 points to allocate across the chart. Once spent, these points cannot be reallocated. These points **CANNOT** be spent in Generic Affinity. 
- Apply any racial affinities to the chart. Affinities are categorized as follows:
	- Positive: +0    
	- Neutral/Not Mentioned: -5
	- Negative: -10

Note: If you choose the Energyweaver you will not gain any racial bonuses in the specialized affinities but the affinity points may be spent on them instead of the normal affinities (worry about this later if you haven’t chosen a class). If you are a beginner it is not recommended you take the Energyweaver class as it is quite difficult to use, so you can probably ignore those boxes for now. 
##### Step 4: Background and Class
Choose a background and a class for your character if you haven't already. Add any bonuses, skills, or features provided by your chosen background and class to your character sheet. At this point, most of your character sheet should be filled out. When selecting your class be sure to apply all of the bonuses this grants, check the Leveling Up section to see what each class gets at level 1 and each other level. 

Think about it like this, your class is like a simple way to measure your profession and how skilled you are in it. A fighter is a person who is good at fighting with weapons and your level in fighter is how good you are at that.

Your background is what sort of life you lived before becoming an adventurer, there are no specific bonuses and instead it exists for role play. For example, if you were a baker then you would have a background of Baker. This means your character lived their life cooking for people in the past and would know things about cooking, the GM may even allow you to have advantage on cooking related rolls because you have experience in that field. For more information see **Section 3.6 Backgrounds and Titles**
##### Step 5: Starting Stats
All characters start with the following:
- Bap (Bonus Action Points): 1
- Ap (Action Points): 1
- Rp (Reaction Points): 1
- Initiative: Dexterity Modifier
- AC (Armor Class): 10 + Dexterity Modifier
- Passive Perception: 10 + Wisdom Modifier
- Speed: Determined by your race.
- Size: Determined by your race.
- Starting Gear: Determined by the GM (See **Section 3.7 Equipment and Starting Gear**).

Roll a hit dice, vitality, dice, and mana dice (decided by your class) and add those to your maximum stats. Your vitality dice will gain a bonus from your Constitution Modifier. For example, if you roll a 4 for vitality and have a +3 in con then you would have a 7 in vitality starting off. Similarly, your mana dice will gain bonus from your Wisdom Modifier. Your hit dice won’t gain any bonuses. If you have a negative con modifier you will lose some vitality, but your vitality, health and mana cannot go below 1 starting off.

It is best to just look at your chosen to see what you get at level 1, it will be different for every class.
