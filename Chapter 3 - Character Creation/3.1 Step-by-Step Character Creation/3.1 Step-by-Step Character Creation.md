Note: This is one of the most important sections for players. Follow it step by step the first time you build a character, and don’t feel rushed. You can always tweak your character later with your GM’s approval.

When creating a character, the first step is to think about their story. It’s best to build characters around their backstory and how they will interact with the game master’s (GM) main narrative. Alternatively, you can focus on mechanics, such as spells, classes, and builds that you find fun to play. However, role-playing should always come first, as it brings your character to life.

##### Step 1: Basic Information

On your character sheet, fill out the following fields:

- Name: The name of your character.
    
- Background: See “Backgrounds” later in the handbook (or worry about it later).
    
- Race: Choose from the race list provided in the handbook.
    

If you are making your character's backstory first take note of the following as well;

- Age: Choose based on the typical lifespan of your race.
    
- Weight: Choose based on the average weight of your race.
    
- Height: Choose based on the average height of your race.
    
- Build: Describe your character’s physique (e.g., muscular, slender, overweight).
    
- Sex: What is your character’s biological sex?
    

It is generally a good idea to have more detailed descriptions of your character’s physical traits and backstory written down separately. 

##### Step 2: Attributes

Next, locate the Attributes section (these are the boxes under the main information, this is only the Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma boxes).

- Each stat starts at 8 (-1) this is a bit below average of a normal human being, so a normal random guy would have an ~12 in all stats if he was perfectly average. 20 is the limit of regular humans, think of an olympic athlete.
    
- You are given 27 points to allocate as you see fit. You can remove points from one stat to add to another, but no stat can go below 4, this allows you to go below average on some stats but not so low you are dysfunctional.
    
- Point Costs:
    

- Each point above 20 in a stat costs 2 points instead of 1.
    
- Each point above 30 costs 3 points, and so on.
    

After allocating your points, apply any racial modifiers to your stats. For example, if your race grants +1 to Strength and your Strength is 22, set it to 22.5 (this will be rounded down for the modifier).

- Calculating Modifiers: Subtract 10 from the ability score, then divide the result by 2 and round down. For example, a score of 15 gives a modifier of +2.
    

The modifiers here are for skill checks during play, so if you are supposed to make a skill check in Athletics and you have a +2 modifier then you roll 1d20 and add 2 to the result. 

##### Step 3: Affinity Chart

Affinities are for magic, simply just how good you are at specific types of magic. The average skill level of someone with any particular type of magic is a -5, however the skill each one starts at is determined by your race. 

Below the Attributes section, you’ll find the Affinity Chart.

- You are given 10 points to allocate across the chart. Once spent, these points cannot be reallocated.
    
- Apply any racial affinities to the chart. Affinities are categorized as follows:
    

- Positive: +0
    
- Neutral/Not Mentioned: -5
    
- Negative: -10
    

Note: If you choose the energy weaver you will not gain any racial bonuses in the specialized affinities but the affinity points may be spent on them instead of the normal affinities (worry about this later if you haven’t chosen a class). 

##### Step 4: Background and Class

Choose a background and a class for your character. Add any bonuses, skills, or features provided by your chosen background and class to your character sheet. At this point, most of your character sheet should be filled out. When selecting your class be sure to apply all of the bonuses this grants, check the Leveling Up section to see what each class gets at level 1 and each other level. 

Think about it like this, your class is like a simple way to measure your profession and how skilled you are in it. A fighter is a person who is good at fighting with weapons and your level in fighter is how good you are at that.

Your background is what sort of life you lived before becoming an adventurer, there are no specific bonuses and instead it exists for role play. For example, if you were a baker then you would have a background of Baker. This means your character lived their life cooking for people in the past and would know things about cooking, the GM may even allow you to have advantage on cooking related rolls because you have experience in that field. 

##### Step 5: Starting Stats

All characters start with the following:

- Bap (Bonus Action Points): 1
    
- Ap (Action Points): 1
    
- Rp (Reaction Points): 1
    
- Initiative: dexMod
    
- AC (Armor Class): 10 + dexMod
    
- Passive Perception: 10 + wisMod
    
- Speed: Determined by your race (see below).
    
- Starting Gear: Determined by the GM.
    

Roll a hit dice, vitality, dice, and mana dice (decided by your class) and add those to your maximum stats. Your vitality dice will gain a bonus from your conMod. For example, if you roll a 4 for vitality and have a +3 in con then you would have a 7 in vitality starting off. Your mana dice will gain a bonus based on your spell casting modifier stat’s modifier. For example, if you have a spellcasting modifier of wisdom being a cleric and a wisdom mod of +3 then you would add 3 to your mana roll. Your hit dice won’t gain any bonuses. If you have a negative con modifier you will lose some vitality, but your vitality, health and mana cannot go below 1 starting off.
