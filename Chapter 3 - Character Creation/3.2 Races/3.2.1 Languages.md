In Eyum, languages are used to communicate, cast spells, conduct diplomacy, and understand ancient lore. Most races begin with at least one known language based on culture or physiology.

Standard Rule:  
You know:

- Your racial language
    
- Common (the shared trade language of most peoples)
    
- 1 bonus language per 10 Intelligence, rounded down (e.g., INT 15 = 1 bonus language)
    

Communication Limits:  
You can only understand, read, write, or speak languages you know. Without shared language, only simple gestures or magical effects (like Comprehend Languages) work.
