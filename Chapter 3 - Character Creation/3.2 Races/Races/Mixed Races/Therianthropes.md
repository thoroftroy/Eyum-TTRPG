- Culture: Therianthropism is a genetic defect that can happen to nearly any creature. It is theorized by some that Stingerfolk, Salamandrians, and some other races were once Therianthropes, but through years of mutation their traits became permanent and much more prominent. Therianthropism is a recessive gene, so offspring do not necessarily gain the same effect as their parents, however if they do the animal will be the same. Some races greatly look down on Therianthropes, but others covet their traits greatly. Therianthropes are found all throughout Eyum except in one culture.  Aurians cannot get Therianthropism, and their gene cancels it out, so if you have any Aurian in your bloodline you cannot get Therianthropism. This is effective for about 4 generations before the blood is too impure. The affinities of Therianthropes are based on their original race and their additional affinities..
