Description: Centaurs are powerful, half-equine, half-humanoid nomads. From the waist down, they bear the muscular frame of a warhorse with thick fetlocks and sure-footed hooves; above, a broad-shouldered humanoid torso carries bow, spear, and burden with practiced ease. Their coats range from dappled gray and bay to rare piebalds and midnight black; skin tones and hair match the human spectrum, though braids, beads, and carved bone totems are common. Eyes are keen and steady, and their breath fogs in cold air like a draft animal at work. When they move, the ground seems to answer, tack jingling, hooves drumming in a cadence that turns to thunder when they charge.  
Culture: Centaur herds roam grass seas, scrublands, and open forest margins, following seasonal grazing and star paths passed down by chant and hoof-prints. Law is oral and immediate: elders arbitrate, champions defend, and all share in herd burdens. Oaths matter, trade promises, escort contracts, and grazing treaties are witnessed by the whole herd and remembered for generations. Camps are circular and efficient, ringed by standing poles hung with wind-bells and fetishes that sing with the weather. Centaurs distrust walls and heavy stone, believing roofs dull the senses; they value open horizons, practical craftsmanship, and endurance over ornament. A centaur that breaks an oath is cast out to walk alone until they reclaim honor with service or sacrifice. Foals learn bowcraft at a run, and even elders drill charges at dawn to keep the herdâ€™s rhythm.

Other:

- Sure-Footed: You have advantage on checks and saves to resist being knocked prone by effects that push, trip, or shove you.
    
- Trampling Charge: If you move at least 20 ft straight toward a creature and hit it with a Hooves attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a Strength Save (DC 14) or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, you may make one extra Hooves attack against it as a bonus action.
    
- Hooves (Natural Weapon): 1d6 bludgeoning; you are proficient with your hooves.
    
- Encumbrance & Climbing: Ladders and narrow vertical shafts are difficult, treat such climbs as requiring a secure ramp or specialized tackle at GM discretion. Tight spaces less than 10 ft wide count as squeezing for you.
