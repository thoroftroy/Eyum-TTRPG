- Description: Naga are serpentine humanoids with a human torso extending from the long, muscular body of a snake. Their scales vary in pattern and hue by lineage, ranging from deep reds and greens to stark white or pitch black. They possess sharp facial features, narrow eyes, and fangs that may be venomous or, in some lineages, absent entirely. Their tails allow them to move with impressive speed and coil for leverage or intimidation in combat. Many rear upright to strike, presenting an imposing silhouette.
    
- Culture: Naga value strength, skill, and cunning above all else. Competition is a constant undercurrent in their interactions, and position in society is earned through ability, not birthright. While often perceived as ruthless, their philosophy is pragmatic, power maintains order, and weakness invites collapse. Alliances form and dissolve based on mutual benefit, and betrayal is seen as a tool rather than a moral failing.
