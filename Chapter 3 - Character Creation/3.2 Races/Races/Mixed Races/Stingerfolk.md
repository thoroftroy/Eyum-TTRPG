- Description: Stingerfolk are towering, armored humanoids with insectoid features, massive scorpion-like tails, clawed hands, and heavy chitinous plating that covers most of their bodies. Their faces are rigid and angular, with mandible-like jaws and segmented eyes that shimmer in dark reds or yellows. Though humanoid in frame, their movements are low and coiled, like a predator ready to strike. Their armor ranges in color from matte black to sandy bronze, often blending with the desert landscapes they call home. Few races can match their natural intimidation, both in size and battle presence.
    
- Culture: Stingerfolk society is rooted in pride, loyalty, and martial honor. Found only in the harsh Saharath desert, their people have adapted to extreme conditions not just physically, but mentally. Strength is respected, but it is not enough, discipline, tradition, and integrity matter just as much. Within a hive or warband, every Stingerfolk knows their role and is expected to fulfill it without complaint. Betrayal is rare and punished severely, while oaths and friendships are lifelong. Stingerfolk do not trust easily, and rarely integrate with other cultures, but they will never abandon an ally in battle once their bond is forged. Outsiders often see them as hostile or brutish, but among their own, they are poets of violence and tacticians of precision.
