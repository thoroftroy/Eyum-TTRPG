Description: Salamandrians are compact, resilient reptilians built for heat and hard ground. Scales run in tight plates over ropey muscle, usually yellow, red, or brown, with rare green lines in shaded regions. Eyes are wide and reflective, slitted for glare, and the snout vents thin threads of heat when they exert themselves. Hands and feet are long toed and gripping, built for sprinting over rock and scrambling up broken stone. Despite their size they hit fast and keep going; a Salamandrian can hold a run long after taller foes fold. Clothing stays light and fireproofed, with ash gray wraps and oiled leathers that won’t scorch. Their voices rasp like breath over coals, and when they laugh it comes as short puffs, more heat than humor.

Culture: Fierce and relentless, Salamandrians sort the world into hunters, hazards, and heat. They crowd together in tight bands when the work is hard, break apart when tempers rise, and reform without apology around whoever has the clearest path to food and safety. Mean streaks are common and often aimed downward; anything not Salamandrian starts at the bottom and must earn space. Mercy is rare but not unknown, it tends to follow displays of stubborn courage. They cannot abide cold; band law centers on fires kept, routes between warm ground, and knowing exactly how far a body can push before chill takes the hands. Nights are for runs, long, steady, and silent, and many bands make their reputation by catching prey that thought darkness would save them. They prize endurance, fire craft, and the ability to read heat like others read maps.
