- Description: Resilient reptilian beings with tough, scaly skin and an affinity for fire. Although they are quite small they tend to be quite fierce. Their bodies are surprisingly strong and agile for their small size. Their scales can be yellow, red, brown, or even green in rare cases. They stand on two legs and look largely humanoid in shape, but very lizardy. 
    
- Culture: Slamandrians are fearsome and relentless, they tend to be quite mean and like to pick on creatures that they deem lesser than them, which is practically anything that isn’t one of them. They can’t survive in the cold so they all live in very hot places. 
    
- Other: They are immune to all heat and fire damages but are hurt quite a bit by the cold (weak to cold). They can also breathe fire and often control it to their will. They also have a unique ability to stay awake for days at a time, often running the entire time to catch up to their prey and take them in the night.
