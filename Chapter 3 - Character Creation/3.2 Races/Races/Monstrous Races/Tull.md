Description: Tull are small, wiry humanoids with hunched postures, mottled green or gray skin, long hooked noses, and jagged teeth. They have thin, flexible limbs, enabling them to scurry, climb, and squeeze into spaces far too small for most humanoids. Their eyes are beady and dart constantly, betraying an instinctive wariness. While individually unimpressive, their strength lies in numbers, when gathered in swarms, Tull move with chaotic precision, overwhelming larger foes through sheer persistence.

Culture: Tull have no formal civilization. They are scavengers and opportunists, living in small nests or following larger, stronger leaders, often other monstrous races who tolerate their presence in exchange for their nimble theft and surprising persistence. While they can be cunning, they are rarely cooperative unless compelled by fear or necessity. Most Tull spend their lives raiding farms, caravans, and settlements, stealing whatever they can carry before fleeing into the wilderness. Attempts to civilize Tull generally fail, as their loyalty is fleeting and their greed easily stoked.
