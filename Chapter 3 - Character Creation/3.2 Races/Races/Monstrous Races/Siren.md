Description: Sirens are amphibious humanoids whose beauty is unrivaled. In water, their legs fuse into a sleek, scaled tail banded in deep blues, jade, or pearl-white; on land, that tail parts into long, lithe legs marked by faint iridescent scales along calves and hips. Fingers are slightly webbed, nails hard as shell, and hair drifts in the slightest breeze as if remembering the tide. Their voices carry a layered resonance that can ripple cups or still a tavern mid-chorus, and their pupils narrow to slits in bright daylight but widen into full, dark discs beneath the waves. Jewelry tends toward coral inlays, polished glass, and hooks of bone; armor is laceless and quick-release, built to shed before a dive.

Culture: Sirens operate in tight hunting packs (“shoals”) whose only goal is to lure in victims and kill them for sport. They stake out coves, river mouths, and shipping lanes, pick a target, and coordinate a simple plan: one or two Sirens make the lure (voice, distress call, or mimicry), the rest wait in the water to drag victims under, disable boats, and finish anyone who falls overboard. They don’t bargain, ransom, or trade; they kill quickly, then strip bodies and wrecks for tools. Shoals rank members by confirmed kills, not age, and they train juveniles by having them assist in drags before allowing a first kill. Standard rules are: leave no witnesses, move hunting grounds if patrols increase, destroy evidence (nets, ropes, anchors) after a hit, and relocate the shoal if a lure is identified. They keep territory clear of other predators and attack any trespassers, including other Siren packs, to protect their hunting routes.

Other:
- Amphibious: You can breathe air and water.
- Tidal Morph: While submerged, your legs become a tail (you cannot use normal land movement, but your swim speed is 50 ft). Out of water, your legs return (you cannot use swim speed unless submerged). Switching is instantaneous when entering/exiting water.
- Siren’s Call (1/Short Rest): As an Action, target one creature within 60 ft that can hear you. It must make a Wisdom Save (DC 15). On a failure, it is Charmed by you for 2 rounds and must use up to 10 ft of its movement on its next turn to move closer to you (this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks). The charm ends early if the target is damaged.
- Undertow Step: While in water, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action once per turn. Difficult terrain in water doesn’t slow your movement.
- Drying Need: If you go 24 hours without submerging in water for at least 10 minutes, you gain -1 to attack rolls and ability checks until you submerge; this penalty stacks by -1 each additional day (the lowest they can make your stats go is 4), and all penalties are removed after submerging for 10 minutes.
