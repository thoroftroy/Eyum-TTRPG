Description: Cyclopes are towering, broad-shouldered humanoids with a single eye set in a heavy brow. Their frames are dense with working muscle; skin tones run slate-gray to sun-baked tan, often scarred from quarry work and siege labor. Hair is coarse and usually braided back from the brow to keep the eye clear. Their lone pupil is large and steady, giving them an unblinking, intimidating stare. Tools and weapons are oversized, stone mauls, iron hooks, and throw-stones the size of a man’s head. Armor is plate-and-hide, strapped to leave the eye and shoulders free to rotate without snagging.

Culture: Most Cyclops clans live in cliffholds near quarries or lava-cut canyons where stone and ore are close at hand. They value direct work and direct speech: if something needs doing, lift it; if a promise is made, keep it. Leadership is simple, whoever solves the biggest problems earns the right to speak first. Clans keep tallies: bridges raised, walls broken, caravans hauled over mountain passes. Outsiders hire Cyclopes as haulers, breakers, and siege-engine crews; payment is counted in metal, salt, and stonecutting rights. While they can be solitary, they travel in work-parties for big jobs, pairing a spotter with each thrower and a lifter with each chiseler. Feuds start over blocked water or stolen stone; they end when someone moves the boulder or returns it. Subtlety is not prized, reliability is.

Other:
- Monocular Focus: You have advantage on saving throws against visual illusions and effects that impose disadvantage due to visual misdirection (e.g., mirror images, blurs, glamours) however you gain disadvantage on all other perception based checks.
- Depth Blind Spot: You have disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks beyond 30 ft (does not affect thrown boulders granted by this race).
- Boulder Toss (1/Short Rest): As an Action, hurl a quarry stone to 60/120 ft; on a hit, the target takes 2d8 bludgeoning (counts as a Heavy thrown weapon you are proficient with).
- Siege-Born: You deal double damage to objects and structures, and you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to shove or break doors, gates, or barricades.
