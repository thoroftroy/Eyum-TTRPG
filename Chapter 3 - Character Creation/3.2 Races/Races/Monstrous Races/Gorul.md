- Description: Gorul are hulking humanoids with slate-colored skin, tusked jaws, and braided manes of coarse hair. Their muscles ripple beneath thick hide, and their bodies are covered in ceremonial scars, often filled with metal ink or gemstones. Their eyes glow faintly red or orange, especially during battle. Gorul often wear minimal armor, preferring flexible hides that allow full movement.
    
- Culture: Gorul live by strength, but not savagery. They see life as a battle, one fought through struggle, loyalty, and action. To a Gorul, every day is an opportunity to prove worth, not through domination, but through grit. Their warbands are highly organized, held together by oath and deed, not blood. While often portrayed as raiders, Gorul are exceptional builders and hunters, creating fortified settlements in remote places. Their religion venerates endurance and personal legacy, and even their songs are shouted tales of those who stood unyielding in the face of impossible odds.
