Description: Gorul are hulking humanoids with slate colored skin and braided manes of coarse hair that hang from scalp and jaw. Heavy muscles bunch under thick hide marked by ceremonial scars, many inlaid with metal ink or small gemstones that catch firelight like embers. Broad jaws carry outward tusks and the eyes glow faintly red or orange when anger or battle heat rises. Their kit favors flexible hides and strapped plates that leave shoulders and hips free, because they fight by moving, planting, and driving rather than standing still. Every Gorul reads like a line of force, feet set, hips square, hands ready to wrench, lift, and break.

Culture: Gorul measure worth by what you carry through, not what you claim. Warbands bind by oath and deed rather than blood, ranks earned where work is hard, hunts are long, and lines are held. Strength means more than power alone, it means showing up on bad days, taking the load, standing where the push is worst, and doing it again tomorrow. Their songs are shouted accounts of those who did not yield, their shrines hold tools and shields that finished their work, and their leaders keep order by example first and scorn second. Raiding is a tactic, not an identity, and the same hands that break a gate will raise a wall before nightfall. Outsiders who mistake them for simple brutes learn quickly that Gorul are builders and hunters as well as fighters, patient with plans, swift with decisions, and stubborn with promises.

Other:
- Darkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.
- Tusks: Your tusks are natural weapons that deal 1d6 piercing damage. You are proficient with your tusks. When you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you with a tusk attack, you may immediately start a grapple as a free action.    
- Linebreaker: If you move at least 20 ft straight toward a creature and hit it with a melee attack on the same turn, add +1d4 base melee damage to that attack, and the target must succeed on a STR save, DC 12 + Proficiency Bonus + STR mod, or be pushed 5 ft.
- Endure the Push: You have advantage on checks and saving throws to resist being shoved, knocked prone, or forcibly moved.
- Builderâ€™s Hands: You are proficient with Masonry Tools and Carpentry Tools. You have advantage on Search checks to locate structural weak points, bracing points, and stable footing within 10 ft. When you spend 1 minute working with available materials, you can raise a waist high barricade that provides half cover to one Medium creature.
- Warband Rhythm: While you are adjacent to at least one conscious ally, you gain +1 AC. Once per short rest, as a bonus action, choose one ally within 15 ft who can see or hear you; that ally gains +1 Base Acc and may move 10 ft without provoking opportunity attacks before the start of your next turn.
- Scent for Blood: You have advantage on Search checks to track wounded creatures within 60 ft by scent.
