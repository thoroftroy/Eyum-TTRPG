Description: Minotaurs are towering, bull-headed humanoids whose presence fills doorways and quiets rooms. Corded muscle bunches beneath hide the color of old leather or dark mahogany, while a shag of mane runs from crown to shoulder. Horns are living heraldry, curved, ridged, or cleaver-straight, and many carve victories into them with scrimshawed sigils. Their muzzles breathe in hot, steady huffs; eyes glint with a patient, animal focus that can flip to charge-fury in a heartbeat. Armor is pragmatic and open-hipped to accommodate their quadriceps and tail sweep; favored weapons include long-hafted axes, tower-shields with corner spikes, and greatspears balanced for couching at a run. Underground, their hoofbeats echo like war-drums; in sunlit canyons, their silhouettes look like statues torn free to walk.  
Culture: Labyrinth law shapes Minotaur life. Their citadels are built as living mazes, spirals of habitation, work, and worship, so that every resident learns the hold by hoof and heartbeat. Elders teach “straight honesty in crooked halls”: hospitality to guests who respect the rules; swift, unflinching justice for oath-breakers. A Minotaur’s name is bound to their pathfinding prowess; children earn their adult cord by guiding an elder through a newly cut warren without hesitation. Craft traditions favor stone, bronze, and hammered iron; every stair is counted, every arch measured. Festivals are tests: riddle-runs in blindfold, strength trials in sand-rings, and the Great Quiet, an hour each new moon in which the entire hold falls silent to feel the maze “breathe.” Above all, they prize steadiness: better a slow truth than a fast lie, better a hard path than an easy betrayal. Many serves as caravan wardens or ruin wardens, trading oath-oaths (formal, witnessed compacts) for safe passage across their territories.
