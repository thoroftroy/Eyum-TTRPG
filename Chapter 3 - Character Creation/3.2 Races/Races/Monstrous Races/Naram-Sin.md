Description: Naram-Sin are towering, orc-like humanoids with thick, leathery skin in colors that denote their strength and intelligence. They have massive, muscular frames, coarse black hair, and tusks that curve from their lower jaw. Their presence is one of overwhelming menace, predators bred for slaughter. Every step they take radiates a readiness for violence. Even at rest, their movements are deliberate and predatory, like a big cat waiting to strike.

Culture: The Naram-Sin live for the kill. Death is their purpose, not merely a means to survive. They hunt for the thrill of conquest, and their society is built around warbands led by the strongest and smartest among them. Leadership is not determined by brute strength alone, cunning and command of others are equally vital. Once a leader falls, the next strongest rises without hesitation, ensuring the warband’s purpose is never interrupted. They are organized and disciplined predators, capable of complex tactics in battle. Every Naram-Sin is raised with the expectation that they will take life; mercy is alien to them.
