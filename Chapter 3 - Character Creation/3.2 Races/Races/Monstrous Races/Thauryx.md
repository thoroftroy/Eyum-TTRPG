Description: Thauryx are draconic humanoids plated in overlapping scales the color of worked metal or firelit glass, bronze and gold through obsidian and deep crimson. Horn crests or spine ridges crown the brow, eyes shine like cut gems, and heat or static seems to thrum in the chest when they draw breath. Hands end in heavy talons and feet grip like a raptor’s, with a counterbalancing tail that steadies charges and pivots. Their voices carry a low, furnace rumble, and posture is naturally commanding, shoulders set square and chin lifted as if addressing a hall.

Culture: Thauryx trace blood and honor to ancient wyrms and keep proud clan holds where oaths, rites of ancestry, and trials of mastery govern status. Deeds earn place, especially control over the “inner flame,” the disciplined channeling of elemental breath and temper. Words bind across generations; a broken oath stains the clan’s name until answered by service or sacrifice. Leadership is expected to be decisive and instructive, and rival clans often clash where purpose or pride collides. They respect power, purpose, and recorded history, and their lore keeps tally of line victories, breath disciplines, and mentors who taught restraint as well as wrath.
