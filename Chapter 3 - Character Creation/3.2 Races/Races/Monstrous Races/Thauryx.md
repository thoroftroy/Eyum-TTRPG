- Description: Thauryx are draconic humanoids covered in plated scales, often bronze, gold, obsidian, or crimson. Their eyes shine like polished gems, and their jaws are lined with sharp teeth and the ability to belch elemental force. They have long tails, clawed feet, and armored hands, with horn crests or spines extending from their brows. Their voices rumble with internal power, and their presence commands attention.
    
- Culture: Descendants of ancient wyrms, Thauryx live in proud clan-holds carved into mountain ranges or volcano rims. They believe themselves heirs to the elemental legacy of dragons and conduct elaborate rites of ancestry, combat, and oath-making. Status is earned through deeds, especially mastery over one’s inner flame, both literal and metaphorical. To break one’s word is a shame that spans generations. Thauryx are natural leaders but often clash with other power-seekers. They respect power, purpose, and history above all.
