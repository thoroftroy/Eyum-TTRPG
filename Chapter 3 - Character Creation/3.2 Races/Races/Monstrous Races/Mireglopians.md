- Description: Beings made of slime that have a humanoid shape. Typical Mireglopians are blue or green but in rare cases they can also be pink. Mireglopians are able to rearrange their bodies in any way they see fit, as long as they have enough slime to do so. Thus a Mireglopian won’t really have a set look, they just look however they want to. 
    
- Culture: Mireglopians care about freedom more than anything. All beings should be free to do whatever they want. To a Mireglopian any form of restriction is evil. 
    
- Other: Mireglopians are very strong, but not very smart. As a Mireglopian you also gain the following resistances, slashing, piercing, water, air. You also gain total immunity to bludgeoning damage. However, you also gain aversion to heat making fire damage deal 50% more, and when in a location that is over 80 degrees gain disadvantage on all rolls. When over 100 degrees, gain double disadvantage and take 1d6 fire damage per turn. Additionally, when in temperatures under -10 you are unable to change shape and gain disadvantage on skill checks. Anything under -40 will straight up kill you. You also have 50% weakness to cold damage. Additionally, when frozen you lose your immunity to bludgeoning and it is instead replaced by weakness to bludgeoning. (Resistance to (non magical) slashing,  (non magical) piercing, water, air. Weakness to heat and cold)
