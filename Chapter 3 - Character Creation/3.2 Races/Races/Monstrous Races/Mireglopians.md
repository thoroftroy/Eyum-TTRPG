Description: Mireglopians are cohesive slimes given humanoid outline. Their bodies are translucent or pearly in blues and greens, rarely pink, with suspended whorls that flow when they move. Features are suggestions rather than fixed anatomy; a face can smooth into a mask, sprout brows, or widen its mouth as needed, and limbs thicken or taper to match a task. Tools and gear sit in harnesses and bands outside the body, since shape shifts would otherwise shear straps or warp buckles. When rushing, a Mireglopian tends to stream forward with a rolling, liquid stride, then collect itself into a tidy silhouette. Their voices are wet and resonant, like sound carried through water, and emotion reads in their color and opacity—anger darkens, calm clears, fear clouds.

Culture: Mireglopian life is built around consent, fluidity, and refusal of confinement. They value self direction above tradition, and any rule that binds without choice is treated as harm. Communities organize as Pools, loose circles that form, split, and recombine as needs change. Decisions are made by “coalescence,” short gatherings where proposals are shaped until enough people can live with them; anyone who cannot simply flows to another Pool. Work favors roles that reward adaptability, scouting flooded tunnels, salvage, seal and gasket craft, and emergency medicine where hands must become wedges, clamps, or funnels. They teach their young two courtesies: take the shape a situation needs, and never demand that shape from another. Outsiders sometimes read this as selfishness; Mireglopians call it integrity. Bonds are real, but never coerced, and a promise is sacred precisely because it is freely chosen.

Other:
- Amorphous Form: As a bonus action, you may reshape your body, altering limb placement, reach, or proportions. This does not change your statistics, but you can squeeze through openings as narrow as 2 inches without penalties. You have advantage on checks and saving throws to escape a grapple or restraints. You cannot be knocked prone.
- Slime Physiology: You have resistance to nonmagical slashing and nonmagical piercing damage, and immunity to nonmagical bludgeoning damage. You also have resistance to Water damage and Air damage. When you are frozen (see Cold Sensitivity), you lose your bludgeoning immunity and instead have vulnerability to bludgeoning.
- Heat Sensitivity: You have vulnerability to Fire damage. While you remain in ambient temperatures above 80°F, you have disadvantage on all rolls. At temperatures above 100°F, you have double disadvantage on all rolls and take 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of your turns.
- Cold Sensitivity: You have vulnerability to Cold damage. While you remain in ambient temperatures below −10°F, you cannot use Amorphous Form and you have disadvantage on skill checks. At temperatures below −40°F, you die.
- Aquatic Adaptation: You have a swimming speed of 40 ft and can freely reshape to slip through currents and narrow channels.
