- Description: Galdrani are massive, moss-covered humanoids with long, drooping ears and antler-like horns. Their skin ranges from bark-brown to stone-gray and is thick with lichen and fungi. Their eyes glow faintly green, and their voices carry a resonant, almost hollow quality, like wind echoing through canyons. Despite their imposing form, Galdrani move with a quiet grace and often wear long, natural robes interwoven with vines, feathers, or bones from animals they’ve buried.
    
- Culture: Galdrani are reclusive stewards of the wild, often acting as caretakers for entire valleys or forests. They believe every rock, tree, and animal has a spirit, and they see themselves as guardians of the balance between all things. Galdrani rarely build cities or tools, instead cultivating natural environments into sacred groves or hidden stone circles. They are wise but slow to action, preferring to watch and understand rather than interfere. Outsiders often mistake their patience for stupidity, but Galdrani have long memories and subtle power. When provoked, they fight not as warriors but as nature incarnate.
