Description: Galdrani are massive, moss cloaked humanoids whose long, drooping ears frame antler like horns that rise from the brow or crown. Skin runs bark brown to stone gray and carries living patches of lichen and shelf fungi along shoulders, spine, and hips. Their eyes hold a faint green glow, steady as lantern moss, and their voices resonate with a hollow timbre, like wind working through a canyon. For all their size they move quietly, weight set heel to toe with the care of a caretaker walking among roots. Robes and mantles are woven from vine, feather, and bone they have gathered and laid to rest, each piece a record of seasons watched and creatures honored. Hands are broad and steady, nails thick as bark, and when they stand still long enough the forest seems to reclaim them, a slow drift of leaf and spore settling on their shoulders until they move again.

Culture: Galdrani keep to overlooked borders where wild and worked places touch. They hold that stones, waters, trees, and beasts all carry spirit, and they take stewardship as a daily craft rather than a title. They cultivate groves instead of cities, raise standing circles instead of walls, and set their laws in oaths of care, do no needless harm, restore what you use, bury what you break, teach what you learn. Decisions come slowly and deliberately, weighed against the long memory of land, and patience is mistaken for sloth by those who have never watched a hillside heal. They prefer to observe before they interfere, but once their boundary is crossed they answer with the certainty of weather, shaping ground, branch, and stone to turn aside those who will not listen. Stories are carried in quiet rites, funerals for animals they have lain in the earth, seed scatterings for cut clearings, and long walks taken without speech so the world can be heard properly.
