Description: Boaf are tall, broad-shouldered humanoids with thick brown or black fur covering much of their muscular frames. Their faces are brutish and ape-like, with pronounced brows, deep-set eyes, and upward-curving tusks protruding from their lower jaw. Their arms are long and powerful, lending them a predatory, looming stance. While not as physically overwhelming as Grull, their strength is still formidable, and combined with a calculating mind, they are far more dangerous. Their presence carries the weight of command, and their eyes assess every person around them as either a tool or a threat.

Culture: Boaf live by dominance and survival. Leadership is earned through intimidation, cunning, and the ability to keep subordinates in line. They often command bands of Tull and Grull, using fear and manipulation as their greatest weapons. While they see allies as expendable, they rarely waste resources, every creature under their control serves a purpose. Boaf value strength in all its forms: brute force, strategic thinking, and the ability to break an opponent’s will. Most are skilled in battlefield control, herding foes into traps or directing allies for maximum efficiency. Trust is foreign to them, replaced by a constant evaluation of usefulness.
