Description: Boaf are tall, broad shouldered humanoids wrapped in dense brown or black fur over slabbed muscle. Faces carry heavy brows, deep set eyes, and upward curving lower tusks that show when they bare their teeth. Arms hang long and powerful, giving them a looming, predatory posture even at rest. They are not as massively built as Grull, but what they lack in raw bulk they replace with calculation, scanning every room for leverage, every person for weakness. Tusks click when they think, fingers drum on hafts and rails, and their gaze weighs others as tool or threat. Dress is practical and hard wearing, reinforced leathers and chain where blows land, trophy cords and rank marks kept where they will be seen first.

Culture: Boaf organize around dominance and function. Authority is earned by intimidation, planning, and the ability to keep a line from breaking under pressure. Crews mix muscle and mind, a Boaf leader will drive Tull, Grull, or any hireling into a pattern that serves the objective, and waste is treated as failure. Loyalty is transactional, kept so long as the ledger balances, and every bond is tested by usefulness. They train for battlefield control more than spectacle, channeling enemies into kill lanes, breaking nerve with timed shouts and shows of force, ordering allies to strike where impact will ripple. They hoard favors and secrets, punish betrayal without pause, and replace fallen pieces quickly. Trust is rare, respect is measurable, and a Boaf who promises protection expects tribute, information, or obedience in return. Their stories praise victories won by pressure and positioning as much as by strength, and a quiet commander who never loses is prized above a loud one who wins big and bleeds the team.
