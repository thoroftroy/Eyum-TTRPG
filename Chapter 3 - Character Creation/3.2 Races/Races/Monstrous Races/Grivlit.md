- Description: Grivlits are small, wiry humanoids with mottled green-gray skin, oversized ears, and large yellow eyes that gleam with perpetual scheming. Their features are sharp and angular, giving them a fox-like, impish appearance. Grivlits are naturally light on their feet and possess incredibly flexible fingers and toes, perfect for climbing, picking locks, or repurposing items that “weren’t being used.” They rarely walk so much as skitter, hop, or crouch, constantly in motion as though wired with nervous energy. Their clothes are often stitched together from dozens of scraps, and their equipment always seems modified in strange, unpredictable ways.
    
- Culture: Grivlit society thrives in the margins, ruins, sewer networks, shipwreck towns, and dense forest warrens. They operate in loose, informal collectives that reject hierarchy in favor of shifting influence earned through cleverness and daring. Their cities, if they can be called such, are built from salvage, shaped by logic only a Grivlit would understand. Above all, they revere improvisation. To a Grivlit, the cleverest plan is not the one that works, but the one that shouldn’t have worked yet still did. Many outsiders view them as chaotic or untrustworthy, but to Grivlits, trust is shown by pranks, tests, and challenges, not empty kindness. They have an innate talent for mechanical tinkering, magical sabotage, and wild alchemy. While some become brilliant inventors or explosive hazards, others simply drift through the world looking for mischief and momentum.
