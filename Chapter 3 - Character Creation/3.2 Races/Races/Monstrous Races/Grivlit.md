Description: Grivlits are small, wiry humanoids with mottled green gray skin, oversized ears, and large yellow eyes that gleam with perpetual scheming. Their features are sharp and impish, fingers and toes long and flexible for climbing, prying, and “repurposing” anything that was clearly doing nothing important. They rarely just walk, they skitter, hop, and crouch, always in motion as if their thoughts outrun their bodies. Clothing is patchwork and practical, stitched from scavenged scraps with hidden pockets, hook loops, and odd little devices that only make sense to the Grivlit who built them.

Culture: Grivlit communities thrive in the margins, ruins, tunnel webs, ship graveyards, and tight forest warrens. They keep loose collectives instead of formal hierarchies, influence shifting to whoever has the smartest plan today. Settlements are assembled from salvage and logic only a Grivlit would follow, ladders that go nowhere until you need them, doors that open only when a weight is removed, bells that ring in a code of clicks and hisses. Improvisation is a virtue, the best plan is the one that shouldn’t have worked but did, and trust is tested by pranks and challenges more than by promises. Many become clever tinkerers, saboteurs, and wild alchemists, but just as many drift as agile opportunists who live on momentum and nerve.
