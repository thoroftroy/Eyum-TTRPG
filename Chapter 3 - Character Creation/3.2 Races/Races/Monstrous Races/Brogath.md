Description: Brogath are towering, muscle dense humanoids draped in coarse fur the color of rust, soot, or dark earth. Broad shoulders carry a thick, feline spine that coils before it strikes, and long forearms end in heavy, clawed hands built to haul, rend, and climb. Faces blend bear bulk with great cat lines, wide muzzles, heavy jaws, and tusks that curl from the lower jaw. Eyes burn amber or green and track like predators, measuring distance, footing, and nerve. Despite their size they move with explosive grace, a low lunge into a sudden snap of speed, and even their stillness feels wound for motion. Harness and clothing are simple and battle sure, reinforced straps over chest and hips, trophies tied where they will swing in rhythm with a charge.

Culture: Brogath live by tests you can see. Status is earned in rings, on hunts, and at the front of lines, not inherited. A dispute becomes a duel, a boast becomes a trial, and a leader holds the place until someone proves stronger, smarter, or steadier. Aggression sits inside a clean code: never betray your clutch, never strike from behind in a challenge, take losses as lessons, and carry your own weight. Loyalty within a clutch is absolute and practical, everyone trains, everyone scouts, everyone shares, and cowardice is remembered. They value trophies only when they prove a worthy risk, stories only when they teach courage, and plans only when they sharpen the strike. Outsiders are tested rather than welcomed, but a stranger who stands a bout, pulls a load, and keeps a promise can earn a place at the fire.
