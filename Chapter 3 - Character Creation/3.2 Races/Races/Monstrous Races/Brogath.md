- Description: Brogath are towering humanoid beasts, standing nearly eight feet tall and packed with raw, intimidating muscle. Their bodies are covered in thick, coarse fur in shades of brown, black, or rust-red. Their faces resemble a cross between a bear and a great jungle cat, broad muzzles, heavy jaws, and piercing amber or green eyes. Long tusks curl upward from their lower jaws, and their clawed hands are strong enough to crush bone or climb sheer cliffs. Their movements are surprisingly fast for their size, driven by feline reflexes and an explosive, animalistic grace. Despite their savage appearance, their eyes burn with clear intelligence and fierce purpose.
    
- Culture: Brogath society is tribal, primal, and brutally honest. Status is earned in the ring, not inherited, and every member is expected to prove their worth in open combat, survival, or contribution to the hunt. Ritual duels are commonplace, fought for leadership, mates, or even to settle minor disputes. Yet this aggression exists within a rigid code of honor. A Brogath may fight fiercely, but never betrays their pack. Loyalty is paramount, and the bond between clutchmates is considered sacred. Brogath rarely build permanent homes, instead roaming harsh wildernesses in search of prey and challenge. They have little interest in gold, politics, or diplomacy, but value tales of heroism, trophies from worthy foes, and displays of unshakable courage. Outsiders are often met with suspicion, but those who survive a Brogath challenge and show respect may earn a place among them.
