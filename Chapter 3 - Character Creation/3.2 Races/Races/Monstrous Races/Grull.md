Description: Grull are massive, slab-muscled humanoids sheathed in leathery gray hide. Their torsos are barrel wide, shoulders knotted like anchors, and arms hang long and corded, built to smash gates, haul timbers, and tear plating from walls. Heavy jaws frame tusks that jut from the lower jaw, and thick brows throw their small, wary eyes into shadow. Everything about a Grull speaks of impact, stance sunk low, hips square, feet hitting the ground with hammer-weight certainty. Scars cross their chests and forearms in ridges, souvenirs of work as much as war. Gear is brutally practical, chain and studded leather where blows land, braced belts for carrying, and gauntlets wrapped to protect knuckles that do most of the arguing.

Culture: Grull do not keep their own councils or cities; they are the muscle in someone else’s plan. Most live inside Tull nests or under hard-edged leaders who point and pay. Groups rarely hold more than one Grull, because dominance contests burn food and time. A Grull’s loyalty is a ledger of simple entries—meat, praise, a steady supply of things to break—and when the ledger runs dry, the Grull goes looking for a louder drum to follow. They ignore long speeches and strategy until the moment of impact; then instinct and repetition take over. In a line they are terrifyingly useful: they hold doors, carry shields that others hide behind, and end fights by deciding a wall should be somewhere else. Even so, they are not mindless. A Grull knows the value of fear, and their very presence often settles disputes before they start.
