Description: Grull are massive, hulking humanoids with thick, leathery gray skin, heavy jaws, and tusks jutting from their lower jaw. Their arms are disproportionately large and muscular, built for smashing, hauling, and tearing. Their features bear a warped resemblance to their smaller Tull kin, but where Tull are wiry and quick, Grull are living battering rams, unyielding walls of muscle and bone. Even their stance carries weight, each step landing like a hammer on stone.

Culture: Grull have no culture of their own, existing as muscle-for-hire within Tull nests or serving stronger monstrous leaders. They do not cooperate well with each other; most groups contain only a single Grull to avoid constant dominance struggles. A Grull’s loyalty is easily bought with food, praise, or the promise of combat, though it lasts only as long as these needs are met. They have little interest in leadership or strategy, instead relying on raw instinct and brute strength. Despite this, their intimidating presence alone can deter lesser creatures from challenging their allies.
