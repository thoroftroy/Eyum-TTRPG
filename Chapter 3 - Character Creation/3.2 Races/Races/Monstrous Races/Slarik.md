Description: Slarik are amphibious, slick skinned folk built for currents and confined spaces. Scales lie in fine overlapping plates that shed sand and silt, colored deep ocean blues, mangrove greens, or bright silver along the cheeks and spine. Neck slits pulse gently when they breathe, and webbing spans fingers and toes for sudden bursts through water or springy, low impact leaps on land. Eyes are bulbous and glass dark or gilded, adapted to read movement in murk, and their heads cant and click in short bursts when they map a flooded room or reef tunnel. Their speech mixes bubbling consonants with croaks and rapid clicks; sung lines carry surprisingly far underwater. Gear is minimal and corrosion smart: lacquered cords, shell buckles, bone blades, and waxed slings, all tied to sit flat so nothing snags in kelp or wreck rigging.

Culture: Slarik clans root themselves where water talks—reef shelves, mangrove webs, drowned stonework—raising woven nests and shell halls that flex with tide and storm. Lineage follows the mother, and elders called Spine Watchers hold memory through song cycles that bundle history, law, and navigation into melodies everyone can learn by stroke and breath. Community runs communal: catch is pooled, tools rotate, and roles shift with season and current. Outsiders read their humor as slippery because tests and pranks are part of trust building; a guest who laughs, adapts, and listens earns a guide faster than one who bargains. Pacts with sea spirits and sworn promises to guard spawning grounds are taken seriously, and pollution or net thievery is answered fast and in force. Children learn three arts early—song for memory, stillness for stalking, and surge for the strike—and most adults can fight as a pod, breaking lines with timed pushes and drag pulls that turn the water itself into a weapon.
