- Description: Slarik are amphibious creatures with slick, scale-covered skin in hues of deep blue, green, or silver. They have webbed hands and feet, gilled neck-slits, and bulbous black or gold eyes that allow them to see clearly in murky depths. Their bodies are light and flexible, perfect for gliding through water or leaping into combat. Their voices are bubbly and high-pitched, often clicking or croaking in unfamiliar tones.
    
- Culture: Slarik live in shallow reef cities, mangrove-root fortresses, or flooded ruins. Their clans are matrilineal and communal, often guided by elders known as "Spine-Watchers." Songs are sacred in Slarik culture, both as ritual and as memory-keeping. Outsiders find Slarik behavior erratic, but beneath their slippery humor is a deep loyalty to kin and home. They are known to make pacts with sea-spirits and to retaliate harshly against pollution or intrusion.
