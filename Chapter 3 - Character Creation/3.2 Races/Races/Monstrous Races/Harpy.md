Description: Harpies are lean, bird-featured humanoids built for ambush. Shaggy feathers mantle the shoulders and spine; leathered wing-membranes stretch from the forearms to the flanks without limiting their clawed hands. Legs are digitigrade with hooked talons for perching or raking. Faces keep a rough human layout, but the teeth are sharp and the eyes are predatory. They smell of old meat and wind. Gear is whatever they can rip off victims, straps, bone toggles, and stolen knives, kept light enough to take flight at a moment’s notice.

Culture: They flock in small cliffside nests and raid for anything they want. The plan is always simple: spot an isolated target, bait it closer with crude mimicry or obvious traps, then swarm, kill, and strip the body. They don’t haggle or honor deals. Rank is “who got the kill.” If patrols get wise, the flock relocates. They fight each other as easily as anyone else over food, shiny trinkets, or nesting spots. Harpies avoid difficult prey and attack the weak first; mercy isn’t in their vocabulary.

Other:
- Talons (Natural Weapon): 1d6 slashing. When you hit a prone or grappled creature with Talons, add +1d4 slashing once per turn.
- Carrion Shriek (1/Short Rest): As an Action, emit a stunning screech in a 15-ft cone. Creatures in the area must make a Wisdom Save (DC 13) or become Frightened of you until the start of your next turn. On success, they’re immune to your Shriek for 24 hours.
- Scavenger: Advantage on CON saves against ingested poison and disease; you can safely eat spoiled meat.
