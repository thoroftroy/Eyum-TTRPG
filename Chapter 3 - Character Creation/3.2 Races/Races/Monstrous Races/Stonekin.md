- Description: Stonekin are towering humanoid beings composed entirely of stone and crystal, their bodies hewn as if by ancient pressure rather than birth. Their forms are rough and jagged, with mineral veins and embedded shards running along their limbs like living geology. Their heads are blocky and angular, with glowing gem-like eyes and rumbling voices that sound like cracking earth. Each Stonekin is unique, some glitter with opal or quartz, others pulse with a dull magma-red glow. Though they appear heavy and slow, their motion is surprisingly fluid, each step deliberate and unshakable.
    
- Culture: To a Stonekin, battle is not an act of hatred, it is the only thing that still makes them feel alive. These ageless titans wander the Crystal Veil in search of worthy opponents, ancient monsters, or fellow Stonekin with whom to clash. They have no concept of family or companionship, instead defining identity through conflict, durability, and endurance. While they once lived in mountain fortresses and crystal hives, most of these structures now lie abandoned, for Stonekin prefer solitude. Legends tell of entire mountain ranges that rose from the duels of ancient Stonekin champions. They rarely speak, and when they do, it is blunt and direct. Among themselves, they communicate more through gesture and challenge than conversation.
