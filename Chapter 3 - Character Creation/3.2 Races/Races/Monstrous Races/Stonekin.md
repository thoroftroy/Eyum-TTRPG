Description: Stonekin are towering humanoids formed of living stone and crystal, bodies hewn by pressure and time rather than birth. Their frames are rough and angular, veined with mineral seams and faceted inclusions that catch the light as if a mountain were learning to move. Faces are blocky and masklike, eyes set as glowing gemstones, and voices rumble like shifting earth. No two Stonekin share the same geology, some glint with quartz or opal, others glow with dull magma red from deeper seams. Though heavy in appearance, their motion is deliberate and surprisingly fluid, each step placed with the certainty of bedrock.

Culture: Stonekin define identity through endurance. Conflict is not hatred to them, it is proof of purpose, a way to feel the world press back. They wander for long spans between clashes, testing themselves against great beasts, relentless elements, or one another when consent and ground are agreed. Old fortresses and crystal halls exist in stories and ruins, but most Stonekin now keep to solitude, meeting by gesture and challenge rather than long speech. Promises are short and literal, debts are paid in labor or blows, and memory is measured in strata, events layered and compressed into lessons they trust more than songs.

Other:
- Lithic Resilience: You have resistance to slashing damage and piercing damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.
- Stonebond Regeneration: While you are in contact with solid natural stone (not sand, wood, or metal) at the start of your turn, you regain 1d4 Vitality. 
- Darkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.

Positive Affinities: Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Physical, Creation  
Neutral Affinities: Generic  
Negative Affinities: Utility, Craft  

Bonuses: +4 STR, +10 CON, -4 WIS, -5 INT, -5 CHA
#### Stonekin, Alternative Layered Model  
Description: These Stonekin are composed of two functional strata, an Outer Layer and an Inner Core. The Outer Layer is the armored crust that meets the world; the Inner Core is the animating heart. Each stratum can be a different material, shaping defenses and traits. Eyes are gem bright, edges are jagged, and the whole form moves with slow certainty as mass and leverage shift inside the shell.

Bonuses: +2 STR, +4 CON, -4 WIS, -4 INT, -4 CHA  

Other: Darkvision 60 ft, advantage on CON saving throws  

Negatives: -10 Base Acc to all attack types, disadvantage on INT, WIS, and CHA checks and saving throws

Core rules, Layered Composition:
- You track three durability channels: Vitality (as normal for Eyum), plus Outer Layer HP and Inner Core HP.
- Damage application order after Vitality is broken through or bypassed: Outer Layer HP first, then Inner Core HP. If the Inner Core is reduced to 0, you die.
- Healing: Normal healing and magic restore Vitality only. They do not restore Outer Layer HP or Inner Core HP.
- Level recovery: When you gain a level, fully restore both Layer totals to their current maximums, then add your class Hit Die roll (plus CON modifier if your class adds it) to both Outer Layer HP and Inner Core HP. There is no cap; these totals accumulate each level.
- Sheet tracking: Record Inner Core HP in your HP field and Outer Layer HP as your Max HP value for ease of reference.

Regeneration and repair:
- Natural regeneration does not restore either Layer.
- Stonebond Regeneration (if used from the standard model) still restores only Vitality.

Damage types and interactions:
- Unless a material below states otherwise, you take damage normally.
- Any effect that “ignores resistance” or “deals true damage” affects Layers normally.
- Effects that reference “healing” still do not restore Layer HP.

#### Material selection:  
Choose one material for your Outer Layer and one for your Inner Core at character creation. Each material sets a base HP value for that stratum, defines resistances and weaknesses while that stratum still has HP remaining, and may add a note effect.

Usage guidance:
- Only the still-intact stratum grants its resistances, weaknesses, and notes. If the Outer Layer breaks, only the Core’s properties apply until it, too, is broken.
- Speed modifiers from materials apply to your current speed. If both strata grant speed modifiers, apply both while both remain.
- “Reflect,” “explode,” or “retaliate” effects trigger only while the relevant stratum has HP remaining, and only as often as stated.
- If a rule would render you immune to a damage type while a weakness would make you vulnerable to that same type, apply vulnerability first, then immunity if still applicable, per GM adjudication.

This alternative model is significantly more complex than the standard Stonekin. Use only with GM approval and ensure all Layer totals and material effects are recorded clearly on the character sheet.
