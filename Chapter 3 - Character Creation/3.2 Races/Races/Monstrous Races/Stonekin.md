- Description: Stonekin are towering humanoid beings composed entirely of stone and crystal, their bodies hewn as if by ancient pressure rather than birth. Their forms are rough and jagged, with mineral veins and embedded shards running along their limbs like living geology. Their heads are blocky and angular, with glowing gem-like eyes and rumbling voices that sound like cracking earth. Each Stonekin is unique, some glitter with opal or quartz, others pulse with a dull magma-red glow. Though they appear heavy and slow, their motion is surprisingly fluid, each step deliberate and unshakable.
    
- Culture: To a Stonekin, battle is not an act of hatred, it is the only thing that still makes them feel alive. These ageless titans wander the Crystal Veil in search of worthy opponents, ancient monsters, or fellow Stonekin with whom to clash. They have no concept of family or companionship, instead defining identity through conflict, durability, and endurance. While they once lived in mountain fortresses and crystal hives, most of these structures now lie abandoned, for Stonekin prefer solitude. Legends tell of entire mountain ranges that rose from the duels of ancient Stonekin champions. They rarely speak, and when they do, it is blunt and direct. Among themselves, they communicate more through gesture and challenge than conversation.
    
- Other: Resistant to slashing and piercing damage. Vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. Regenerate 1 Vitality per round while in contact with solid stone. Darkvision up to 60 ft.

### Alternative Stonekin Race

An alternate, more complex version of the Stonekin race featuring expanded mechanics and customization. These rules add depth and unique options but are significantly more complicated than the standard Stonekin. Recommended for experienced players, with GM approval before use.

Speed: 20 ft

Description: Stonekin are massive, crystalline humanoids formed of layered geologic strata. Each Stonekin is composed of an Outer Layer and an Inner Core, crafted from specific stone or metal materials. These layers define their resilience, elemental affinities, and combat properties. Their glowing gem-like eyes and jagged frames mark them as ancient beings, artifacts of pressure, time, and war.

Positive Affinities: Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Physical, Creation

Neutral Affinities: Generic

Negative Affinities: Utility, Craft

Bonuses: +2 str, +4 con, -4 wis, -4 int, -4 char

Other Bonuses: Darkvision up to 60 ft, advantage on con saving throws. 

Negatives: -10 all base accuracy, disadvantage on all int, wis, and char rolls.

Core Mechanic - Layered Composition:

Stonekin do not use traditional HP like other races. Instead, they have two durability layers:

- Outer Layer: Primary damage buffer.
    
- Inner Core: Secondary buffer. Once depleted, the Stonekin dies.
    
- Vitality: Still present and functions normally to represent near-misses and glancing blows. However, damage that bypasses Vitality chips the Outer Layer first, then the Core.
    

Regeneration Rule:

Neither layer regenerates naturally. Only leveling up restores lost Outer/Core HP. Magical healing restores Vitality only. Certain magical items or rituals may restore layers at GM discretion.

Hit Dice and Layer Scaling:

Stonekin gain additional HP to both their Outer Layer and Core from their class hit dice, just like other characters. However, unlike traditional HP, these layers cannot be healed by any means except leveling up.

- The base Outer HP and base Core HP are determined by your chosen material.
    
- At each level, you add your hit die result (plus CON modifier, if applicable) to both the Outer Layer and the Core.
    
- There is no maximum HP cap for either layer, these totals accumulate each level.
    
- If a layer has been broken or partially depleted, it is restored to its full value upon leveling up then you add your hit dice.
    

Stonekin do still track normal Vitality, which functions as usual and can be restored with rest or healing.

Marking it on Your Character Sheet:

Since you do not use traditional maximum HP, record your Inner Core HP in the regular HP field, and place your Outer Layer HP in the maximum HP field.
