Description: Trolls are towering, knot-muscled humanoids with rubbery moss-green skin, long arms, and clawed hands that never stop flexing. Their flesh stitches itself back together in stringy strands, leaving puckered seams that heal as you watch. Eyes are small and pale; their noses are broad and scarred from countless breaks. They shamble when calm, then lunge with horrifying speed the instant blood is in the air.  
Culture: Trolls don’t build; they claim. They haunt ruins, cave networks, and shadowed forests, bullying Tull and Grull into service. Leadership is whoever hit the hardest most recently. They respect fear, meat, and shade, anyone who keeps them fed and out of the sun earns a temporary peace.

Special Abilities:

- Regenerative Flesh: At the start of your turn, regain 1d6 + CON mod HP. If you took fire or radiant damage since your last turn, or are in direct sunlight, this regeneration doesn’t trigger that turn. Lost fingers/ears regrow after a Short Rest; lost limbs regrow after a Long Rest.
    
- Sunlight Burn: While in direct sunlight (Bright Light from the sun), you take 2d4 radiant damage at the start of each of your turns, have disadvantage on attack rolls and all perception based rolls, and your Regenerative Flesh is suppressed. Stepping into shade or Dim Light ends the damage on your next turn’s start. Heavy clouds count as Dim Light; torches/lanterns/Light spell don’t trigger this.
    
- Troll Hide: Resistance to non-magical slashing and piercing damage from Medium or smaller wielders.
    
- Rending Claws: Natural weapon, 1d6 slashing. On a crit, the target begins Bleeding (per your condition rules) until stabilized.
    
- Relentless Horror (1/Long Rest): When you would be reduced to 0 HP, you drop to 1 HP instead unless the triggering damage is fire or radiant or you are in direct sunlight.
