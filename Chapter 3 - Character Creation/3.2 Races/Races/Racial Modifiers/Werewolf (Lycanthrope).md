Description: Werewolves are humanoids cursed or blood-bound to a predatory spirit of the Moon. In daylight they pass as their base race, though canines run a little long, eyes catch too much light, and a faint animal musk clings to their clothes. When the pulse quickens, anger, fear, or the call of the moon, the Hybrid emerges: fur along the forearms and spine, digitigrade legs, lengthened jaw with killing teeth, and hands that end in hooked claws capable of rending mail. Voices deepen to a lupine rasp; scents read like sentences: fear, iron, rain, lies. In full bestial focus, the world narrows to wind direction, heartbeat, footing, and the clean geometry of the chase.

Culture: Most werewolves keep to moon-lodges, loose, secret networks that teach control, set hunting codes, and police their own. “No blood without a reason” is the first law; “no broken oath” is the last. Packs treat the curse as a demanding craft: diet, drills, breathwork, and ritual sparring under silvered brands. Some lodges serve as night-wardens for border towns, paid in meat and discretion. Others become road-wolves, selling nose and claw to caravans as pathfinders and ambush-breakers. Within the pack, status is earned by restraint more than rage. Lone werewolves (called strays) wander until a deed or debt binds them. Silver is taboo and kept for penance and trial by pain; those who abuse the curse are marked and hunted by their own.

Other:

- Shapeshift (Hybrid): As an Action, transform between Humanoid and Hybrid. Equipment merges where feasible (GM discretion). While Hybrid, you gain Claws and Bite natural weapons, Darkvision 60 ft, and your Speed is 35 ft if it was lower. You can speak and cast, but somatic components are harder, treat checks that require fine manipulation as at disadvantage unless you’ve practiced tools/spellcasting in Hybrid (GM discretion).
    

- Claws: 1d6 Slashing (finesse).
    
- Bite: 1d6 Piercing; on a hit you may choose to deal +1d4 Necrotic once per turn as you draw on the curse.
    

- Feral Resilience: At the start of your turn, if you took no silver or radiant damage since your last turn, you regain 1d4 HP (does not function at 0 HP).
    
- Predator’s Senses: You have advantage on Perception and Survival checks that rely on smell or hearing.
    
- Pack Instinct: If an ally is within 5 ft of a creature you can see, you have advantage on your first melee attack against that creature each turn.
    
- Moonbound: During night or under bright moonlight, you have advantage on Strength checks.
    
- Silverbane: Damage from silvered weapons always deals double damage to you. 
    
- Self-Mastery: When you take damage while at half HP or lower, you may use your Reaction to make a WIS (DC 12) self-control check. On a success you immediately end Frightened or Charmed on yourself; on a failure you must move at least 10 ft toward the nearest hostile creature on your next turn before taking other actions (does not force you to provoke if avoidable).
