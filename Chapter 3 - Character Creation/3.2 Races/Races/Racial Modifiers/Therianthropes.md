Description: Therianthropes are stable human-animal hybrids. The face and overall frame remain humanoid, but distinct animal traits replace or overlay features such as ears, eyes, hands, legs, feet, or tail. These traits are not cosmetic, they carry usable physiology and instincts. A Therianthrope’s mannerisms often echo the source animal, quick glances and sudden stillness in cat lines, open alert posture and rapid tail signaling in dog lines, heavy-set power and deliberate motion in bear lines, twitchy head movements and light stride in bird lines, and so on. Clothing is adapted for tails, wings, or unusual gait, with reinforced seams and harness points for gear. Most individuals learn a “quiet stance” to keep their animal tells in check during negotiation or travel among strangers.

Culture: Therianthropism is a recessive, heritable condition that can appear in most peoples. The animal lineage, once expressed, remains constant down that branch of the family. Two Therianthrope parents do not guarantee a Therianthrope child, but when a child is born affected, it matches the parent’s animal line unless a different recessive line expresses from the other side. Aurians cannot express Therianthropism, and Aurian blood suppresses expression for roughly four generations. Social response varies by region and people, some communities prize Therianthropes as scouts, couriers, or champions, others stigmatize them as unstable. Most Therianthropes learn to navigate both admiration and suspicion. Affinities are inherited from the original race first, then the animal line may add additional positives as noted below.
