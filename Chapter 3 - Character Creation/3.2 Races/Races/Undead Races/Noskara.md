Description: Noskara are pale, sharp featured humanoids with blood hued eyes and elongated fangs set in precise, predatory smiles. Their skin is cool to the touch, and a faint chill seems to follow them into quiet rooms and crowded halls alike. Nails grow as fine, hard claws, tailored more often than cut, and their movements are unhurried, deliberate, and exact. Many favor austere finery or ritual dress that frames the face and throat, a cultivated image of control that suits voices smooth as lacquer and layered with an unplaceable accent. Even at ease they read the room, selecting words like tools and silences like blades.

Culture: Noskara gather in cloistered courts and secluded covens where etiquette rules with the weight of law. They treat the world as stage and board both, measuring people as pieces, patrons, or prey. Long lives and sharper memories bind them to oaths, invitations, and old pacts; propriety is compulsion as much as preference, and a broken word can stain a name for a century. Power is currency, but restraint is art, and the most dangerous among them learn to feed appearances as carefully as they feed on blood. Some rule from shadow as patrons, others stalk openly as predators; many try to live among mortals under rigid codes that keep hunger and ambition from burning away the mask.

Other:
- Darkvision: You can see in darkness up to 120 ft.
- Undead: You are technically counted as undead
- Necrotic Resilience: You have resistance to Necrotic damage.
- Radiant Aversion: You have vulnerability to Radiant damage.
- Blood Siphon: Once per turn when you hit a living creature with blood using a melee weapon attack, you restore 1d4 Vitality. This has no effect on constructs, elementals, or creatures without blood at GM discretion.
- Velvet Command: Once per short rest, as an action choose one creature within 30 ft that can see or hear you. It must succeed on a WIS save, DC 12 + Proficiency Bonus + CHA mod, or be charmed by you for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success or if it takes damage from you or your allies. While charmed, it will not target you with attacks and treats your requests as reasonable within its normal limits.
