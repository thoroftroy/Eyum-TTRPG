- Description: Noskara are pale, sharp-featured humanoids with elongated fangs and blood-hued eyes. Their skin is cool to the touch, and their presence often chills the air subtly. Many Noskara have an aura of refined menace, sharp suits, ritualistic attire, or noble dress are common. Their hands end in precise, claw-like nails, and their voices are unnaturally smooth, often tinged with some unplaceable accent.
    
- Culture: Noskara live in cloistered noble courts or secluded covens, viewing the rest of the world as either prey or entertainment. Most see themselves as superior beings,  nearly immortal, calculating, and entitled to shape fate through power. However, Noskara are deeply bound by tradition and ritual, often unable to resist the allure of propriety, invitation, or ancient pacts. While some become monstrous parasites, others attempt to live among mortals with restraint. The line between predator and patron is often blurry in Noskara society.
