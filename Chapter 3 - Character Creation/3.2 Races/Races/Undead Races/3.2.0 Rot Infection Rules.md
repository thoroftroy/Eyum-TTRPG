Rot Infection is a necrotic contagion carried by the bites of Rotborn and, rarely, Witherkin. It can affect any living creature except those inherently immune to disease and undeath (such as Veythari, Relicwraiths, Smogborn, and Ferramites). The infection spreads through the magical corruption of blood and tissue rather than through natural pathogens.

Transmission:

- Any living creature bitten by a Rotborn or Witherkin must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC in Statblock) or become infected. Each subsequent bite increases the DC by 2. 
    
- If the bite reduces the target to 0 HP, the saving throw is automatically failed.
    
- Magical healing applied before the end of the creature’s next turn removes the infection before it takes hold, but if you are not healed quickly enough you must use a spell such as Purge Corruption to remove the effect before it kills the creature. 
    

Effects on Different Targets:

- Player Characters/NPCs (Sentient Races): Once infected, the target’s health begins to fail rapidly. At the start of each long rest, the target must succeed on another Constitution saving throw (DC 12 + 1 for each day since infection). On a failure, they take 2d10 damage to health, if this kills them they rise as a Rotborn after 1d6 hours, at this point it is impossible to save them. If killed by any means while infected, they immediately rise as a Rotborn unless burned to ash.
    
- Animals: Infected animals die and rise as bestial Rotborn versions of themselves after 1d4 hours, losing all special training and becoming aggressive to all living creatures.
    
- Monsters: Infected monsters become Rotborn variants of their species after 1d4 hours, retaining only physical abilities that do not require complex thought. 
    

Becoming a Witherkin Instead of a Rotborn

- When a creature dies while infected and would normally rise as a Rotborn, they may immediately attempt a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18). On a success, the creature rises as a Witherkin instead. For the next 7 days, at the start of each day, the creature must repeat the same saving throw (DC 18). Failing even one of these saving throws causes the creature to lose their sentience and revert permanently to a Rotborn. If all 7 saving throws are passed, the transformation is stabilized, and the creature remains a Witherkin permanently.
    
- During the same 7-day period, the creature must also attempt an Intelligence saving throw (DC 16) at the start of each day to retain fragments of their past life. If all Intelligence saving throws fail, the Witherkin loses all memory of their previous existence by the end of the week, their mind becoming a blank slate. If at least one Intelligence saving throw is successful, their memories are not entirely lost, while inaccessible at first, they can be recovered over time through reliving similar experiences or encountering familiar people and places, as determined by the GM.
    

Special Notes:

- Rotborn bites bypass non-magical resistance to disease.
    
- Witherkin may choose whether their bite carries the infection, but once delivered it cannot be undone.
    
- Fire damage to the corpse before reanimation prevents the transformation entirely.
    

- Similarly, burning the wound sufficiently quickly will also stop the spread. 
    

- Creatures turned into Rotborn retain the general size, body shape, and physical stats of their original form but suffer all Rotborn penalties and gain all of the rotborn abilities.
    
- If a creature survives the infection through passing the Infected Saving Throw 7 times in a row, they are immune to Rot Infection for 30 days before they can be infected again.
    

- This immunity does not apply to witherkin bites as they are far more potent.
