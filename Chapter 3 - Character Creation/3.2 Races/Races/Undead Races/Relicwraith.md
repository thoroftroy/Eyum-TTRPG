Description: Relicwraiths are beings of condensed mana bound to a single physical Anchor. In manifestation they appear as shimmering silhouettes of color and light, edges wavering like heat haze, with only the suggestion of eyes and a mouth. Their steps make no sound, they cast no shadow, and their forms can slip partly into nonmagical matter without fully passing through it. Each Relicwraith’s Anchor, a weapon, relic, or trinket, is etched with runes or patterns that mirror its will; breaking this Anchor ends the Relicwraith. They manipulate the world through steady telekinetic technique rather than touch, arranging tools and moving objects with patient precision.

Culture: Most Relicwraiths arise where magic peaks, when ambient mana coheres around an object during moments of shock or sacrifice. They are solitary by nature and avoid exposing their Anchors, relying on careful planning, layered wards, and strategic retreat rather than brute force. Small convocations form in places of strong mana to share glyphs, histories, and techniques for channeling through distance. Etiquette is strict: never ask to see another’s Anchor, never touch an Anchor without consent, never reveal an Anchor’s resting place. They prize ingenuity, control, and craft, recording memory as glyphwork and embedding insight directly into the Anchor’s design.

Other:
- Anchor Bound: You are tethered to your Anchor and cannot willingly move more than 50 ft from it. If you are forcibly teleported, your Anchor teleports with you. If your Anchor is ever more than 50 ft from you due to outside effects, you are pulled to its space and become dormant until the start of your next turn.
- Two Pools, One Life: You track manifestation Vitality as normal, but your manifestation has no Health. If an effect would bypass Vitality and deal Health damage, it instead reduces your Vitality. If your Vitality reaches 0, you immediately retreat into your Anchor and become dormant; you remanifest only after completing a full long rest. Your Anchor has no Vitality, only Health; if it is reduced to 0 Health, the Anchor is destroyed and you die.
- Targeting the Anchor: While you are carrying or wearing your Anchor, attacks against it target your AC and saving throws. If the Anchor is unattended, it uses object AC and saving throw rules at the GM’s discretion. Area effects that include your space also include your Anchor.
- Incorporeal Mantle: In manifestation form you are immune to all nonmagical damage that does not directly target your Anchor. Magical sources, enchanted weapons, or effects that explicitly harm incorporeal or mana based creatures affect you normally.
- Condition Immunities: In manifestation you are immune to the following conditions, blinded, deafened, grappled, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned.
- Phase Edge: You may overlap nonmagical solid matter by up to 2 inches. This does not allow passage through a barrier and you must end movement in an open space.
- Spectral Hands: You have two permanent telekinetic hands. Each can manipulate objects within 30 ft and lift up to 10 lbs independently, or 20 lbs together. They cannot wield weapons or make attacks. Finer tasks, locks, and tools can be handled as if with normal hands.
- Arcane Focus: You gain +2 to your spell save DC and advantage on all spell attack rolls.
- Fragile Force: You have disadvantage on Strength based attack rolls. When a Strength based attack you make deals damage, reduce that attack’s damage by 2 before applying modifiers.
- Manifold Reserves: You gain +2 Vitality each time you gain a character level.
- Dormant Form: While dormant inside the Anchor, you are unconscious and unaware. If the Anchor takes damage while you are dormant, you sense it and may remanifest at the start of your next turn if you have completed a full long rest since your last manifestation.
