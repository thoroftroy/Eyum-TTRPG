Description: The Veythari are not born, they are made. Once a mortal, their body and spirit are forever changed after surviving the bite of another Veythari. This transformation is carried through blood; the attacker forces a trace of their own crimson essence into the victim through their fangs, rewriting the victim’s body with mana-laced vitae. Veythari retain all the physical features, racial traits, and cultural markers of their original race, but their eyes often take on a subtle crimson, gold, or violet sheen, and their canines sharpen into predatory fangs. Their movements are unnervingly graceful and silent, and their voices can carry a strange, compelling cadence. Though alive, their altered physiology demands blood as sustenance; while they can survive for short periods without it, their body weakens and their magical prowess fades without regular feeding.  
Culture: There is no unified Veythari culture; they are scattered among the peoples from which they were turned, blending seamlessly into mortal society or withdrawing into nocturnal enclaves. However, certain shared instincts emerge, an aversion to open sunlight, a subtle predatory awareness of others’ heartbeats, and a compulsion to guard their true nature. Some live openly among their kind in hidden strongholds, where ancient turned elders govern in secrecy and pass down forbidden magical rites. Others are solitary, viewing their existence as a curse, and feeding only when absolutely necessary. All Veythari understand the silent etiquette between their kind: never reveal another Veythari’s identity to outsiders, and never turn a new Veythari without cause.  
Other: The Veythari template overlays an existing race; the transformed being retains all positive, neutral, and negative affinities of their original race unless directly contradicted by the Veythari traits. Weakness to sunlight (begin taking 1d4 radiant damage per turn after 3 consecutive turns in direct sunlight, ignoring vitality) and weakness to radiant damage. Immune to disease and poison. Requires regular blood consumption (at least once every 7 days) or suffers 1 level of exhaustion per day without it. Gains the following progression:

- Level 1+: Darkvision 60 ft (or +30 ft if already possessed), bite attack (1d6 piercing + 1d4 necrotic, restores vitality equal to necrotic damage dealt), advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to grapple.
    
- Level 5+: Blood Charm (Action) (DC 10; increases by +2 every 5 levels). On a failed save, the target is charmed (advantage on Charisma checks against them). If the target fails by more than half the DC, they are heavily charmed and must follow all commands given by the Veythari. Each turn, the victim may attempt another Wisdom save to break free. Heavy charm does not reapply on repeated failures. All charm effects last a maximum of 1 minute unless manually reapplied.
    
- Level 10+: Shapechange (bat form; bonus action to shift; flight speed 40 ft). Maintains the same health, vitality, and abilities as normal. May remain in bat form indefinitely.
    
- Level 15+: Greater Veythari Form: Gain permanent 25 ft flying speed in normal form, increase bat form speed to 80 ft, and gain resistance to non-magical damage.
    
- Level 20+: Legendary Resilience: Once per short rest, when reduced to 0 HP, instead drop to 1 HP.
