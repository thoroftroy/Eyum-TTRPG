Description: The Veythari are made, not born. A living mortal survives the bite of a Veythari, and crimson, mana laced vitae rewrites flesh and spirit. The transformed retain their original race’s features and cultural markers, but the eyes take a subtle crimson, gold, or violet sheen and the canines lengthen to predatory fangs. Movements become unnervingly silent and precise, voice cadence turns compelling, and pulse, breath, and temperature drift toward stillness. They remain alive, but the altered physiology demands blood; without regular feeding the body weakens, reflexes dull, and spellwork frays.

Culture: There is no single Veythari nation. Most hide among their birth peoples or keep to nocturnal enclaves under elder guidance. Common instincts emerge across lines, an aversion to open sunlight, constant awareness of nearby heartbeats, and fierce protection of secrecy. Etiquette among their kind is simple and strict, never reveal another Veythari’s nature to outsiders, never turn a new Veythari without cause, settle disputes away from witnesses, and repay debts quickly. Some rule from behind masks as patrons and scholars; others treat the condition as a curse and feed only when need overwhelms restraint. However they live, all understand the cost of hunger and the weight of an oath.

Other:
- Template: Apply these traits to a living character; you retain your base race’s features and all affinities unless a Veythari trait directly contradicts them.
- Sunlight Averse: After 3 consecutive turns in direct, unfiltered sunlight, you take 1d4 radiant damage each turn, ignoring Vitality, until you leave sunlight or gain total cover. You have vulnerability to Radiant damage.
- Blood Requirement: You must drink blood at least once every 7 days. Each full day beyond this limit imposes 1 level of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained this way ends immediately when you feed.
- Living Immunities: You are immune to disease and poison.
- Darkvision: 60 ft, or increase an existing Darkvision range by +30 ft (maximum 120 ft).
- Bite: Natural weapon, 1d6 piercing + 1d4 necrotic. On a hit against a living, blooded creature, you restore Vitality equal to the necrotic damage rolled. Constructs, elementals, and creatures without blood are unaffected at GM discretion.
- Predatory Grapple: You have advantage on checks to grapple and to maintain a grapple.
- Blood Charm: Starting at character level 5, as an action you may target one creature within 30 ft that can see or hear you. DC 10 at levels 5–9, DC 12 at 10–14, DC 14 at 15–19, DC 16 at 20. On a failure the target is charmed for up to 1 minute and you have advantage on Charisma checks against it. If the target fails by more than half the DC, it is heavily charmed for up to 1 minute and must follow your commands within its normal limits. The target repeats the WIS save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success or if it takes damage from you or your allies. Heavy charm does not reapply on repeated failures within the same use. One use per short rest.
- Shapechange, Bat: Starting at character level 10, as a bonus action you may assume a bat form with 40 ft fly speed. You retain your Health, Vitality, and abilities. You may remain in bat form indefinitely and revert as a bonus action.
- Greater Veythari: Starting at character level 15, you gain a permanent 25 ft fly speed in your normal form, your bat form fly speed increases to 80 ft, and you gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage.
- Legendary Resilience: Starting at character level 20, once per short rest when you would be reduced to 0 Health, you instead drop to 1 Health.
