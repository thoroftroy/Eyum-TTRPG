Description: Rotborn are mindless dead animated by malign impulse. Flesh sloughs, joints creak, and insects nest where organs once worked. They neither breathe nor tire nor feel pain, and they pursue living prey until destroyed or diverted. Memory, personality, and judgment are gone; only hunger remains. A Rotborn’s bite carries Rot Infection, a taint that guarantees the victim will rise as Rotborn upon death unless powerful magic purges the blight beforehand.

Culture: None. Rotborn drift, then swarm when prey is near. Without direction they wander; under Witherkin or necromancer control they’re driven like siege cattle toward chosen targets. They do not distinguish ally from foe, only living from dead.

Other:
- Template: Apply to a corpse of any race, animal, or monster. Replace statistics as noted here; retain original Size and natural movement types, then apply Speed reduction.
- Undead Nature: You do not need air, food, drink, or sleep. You are immune to disease, poison, exhaustion, charm, and fear.
- Resistances and Vulnerabilities: You are vulnerable to Radiant damage. You have a special weakness to Fire, any Fire damage you take prevents your Resurrection Roll trait from functioning until after your next long rest.
- Clumsy Hands: You cannot wield weapons or tools unless you are under the direct command of a controlling entity; even then, you wield them at the GM’s discretion with any penalties the controller imposes.
- Dark Purpose: Mindless. You cannot cast spells, speak languages, or make complex plans. Simple commands such as “follow,” “guard,” “attack that,” or “bring bodies” can be obeyed if issued by a Witherkin or necromancer you recognize as a controller.
- Resurrection Roll: When reduced to 0 Health, roll 1d20. On 11 or higher, you instead drop to 1 Health. This can occur up to 3 times per long rest. If Fire damage has affected you since your last turn, this trait is suppressed until you complete a long rest.
- Rot Vitality: Healing that restores Vitality functions normally on you. Effects that restore Health work only if they can affect undead, at GM discretion.

Rotborn Bite  
Melee attack, reach 5 ft, one target. On a hit, 1d6 piercing damage plus 1d4 necrotic damage. You restore Vitality equal to the necrotic damage rolled. The target must succeed on a CON save, DC 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your STR mod, or contract Rot Infection. Each subsequent bite you land on the same creature within 2 hours increases this save DC by 2. This escalation resets if the creature goes 2 hours without being bitten again.

Rot Infection, rules
- Onset and course: The infection is dormant while the victim lives. It imposes no penalties by itself; its sole function is reanimation on death.
- Reanimation: If an infected creature dies while still infected, it rises as a Rotborn under GM control after 1d4 hours, with Rotborn statistics appropriate to its original form. Remove equipment as the GM deems the corpse lost or ruined.
- Curing the blight: Before the creature dies, powerful purgative magic can remove Rot Infection. Suitable effects are set by the GM; examples include high tier cleanse, remove blight, or comparable restorative rituals. Once dead, only effects capable of returning a creature to life while purging curses and diseases prevent reanimation.
- Fire sanctification: If the corpse takes any Fire damage before the reanimation occurs, the reanimation is delayed until after the next long rest that passes without the body taking Fire damage again. If sufficient fire wholly destroys the corpse, no reanimation occurs.
