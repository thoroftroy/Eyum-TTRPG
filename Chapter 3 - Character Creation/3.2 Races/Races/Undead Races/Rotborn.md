Description: Rotborn are the mindless dead, animated corpses driven by a single instinct: to kill and spread their condition. Their bodies are twisted by decay, missing limbs or organs, and often smeared with dried blood or crawling with carrion insects. They do not tire, breathe, or feel pain, and will relentlessly pursue living prey. They retain none of their former personality or intelligence. Their bite spreads their condition to any living creature, be it mortal, animal, or monster. Once bitten, the victim will inevitably rise as Rotborn unless cured by powerful magic before death.

Culture: Rotborn have no culture, only hunger. They operate on instinct, forming swarms that hunt together for efficiency. Often, a Witherkin or necromancer will drive them toward strategic targets. Without leadership, they drift aimlessly, wandering until they sense prey. They do not distinguish between friend or foe, only living or dead.

Other: Template overlays existing form. Weakness to fire damage: any fire damage taken prevents their resurrection roll until after their next long rest. When reduced to 0 HP, roll 1d20: on 11+, they instead drop to 1 HP. This can occur up to 3 times per long rest. Immune to disease, poison, exhaustion, charm, and fear. Vulnerable to radiant damage. Cannot wield weapons or tools unless directed by a controlling entity.

Bonuses: -2 str, -3 dex, -2 con, -4 int, -4 wis, -4 cha

Rotborn Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 1d6 piercing damage + 1d4 necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Strength modifier) or become infected with Rot Infection. Necrotic damage dealt by this bite restores vitality to the Rotborn equal to the necrotic damage rolled. Each subsequent bite on the same creature increases the DC by 2, this resets after 2 hours of not being bitten.
