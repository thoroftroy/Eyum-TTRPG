Description: Relicwraiths are beings of pure mana, lacking any physical body. In their manifestation form, they appear as shimmering silhouettes of light and color, shifting like heat haze, with no true facial features beyond the vague suggestion of eyes and a mouth. Their forms cast no shadow, make no sound when moving, and can phase partially through non-magical matter, though they cannot pass entirely through solid objects. Every Relicwraith is bound to a physical object, called an Anchor, which serves as their tether to the material world. The Anchor can be anything from a weapon to a trinket, and often bears runes, etchings, or patterns related to the Wraith’s personality or origin. Destroying the Anchor destroys the Relicwraith.

Culture: Relicwraiths are rare and mysterious, believed to be formed in moments of extreme magical resonance, when ambient mana condenses into sentience and binds itself to the nearest object. They are solitary by nature, though small enclaves exist in hidden ruins and deep mana wells where magic is strongest. Since their manifestation forms cannot physically manipulate the world, Relicwraiths rely on their permanent mage hands for interaction. This limitation has fostered a culture that values ingenuity, magical prowess, and strategic thinking over brute force. Physical combat is shunned, Relicwraiths see it as crude and inefficient, while mastery of magic is seen as the highest art. They maintain detailed oral histories and complex mana glyphs to record their experiences, often embedding their knowledge into the very runes of their Anchors. Trust with outsiders is rare, as exposing one’s Anchor to another is to place one’s life in their hands.

Other: Immune to all non-magical damage in manifestation form unless their Anchor is directly attacked. Immune to all the following conditions: Blinded, Deafened, Grappled, Incapacitated, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, Prone, Restrained, Stunned. Two separate health pools: Manifestation Form has only Vitality; damage that would normally bypass Vitality instead affects it normally. If Vitality reaches 0, the Relicwraith is forced to retreat into its Anchor and falls dormant, requiring a full long rest before remanifesting. The Anchor has no Vitality, only Health; if reduced to 0 Health, the Anchor is destroyed and the Relicwraith dies. Manifestation form cannot physically interact with the world except through two permanent mage hands (each lifts 10 lbs freely; more weight can be lifted by channeling mana as per Mage Hand rules). Gains +2 Vitality per level. Disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls and damage, but +2 to spell save DC and advantage on all spell attack rolls. A Relicwraith cannot move more than 50 ft from their Anchor. If a Relicwraith is teleported forcibly, their Anchor is teleported with them.
