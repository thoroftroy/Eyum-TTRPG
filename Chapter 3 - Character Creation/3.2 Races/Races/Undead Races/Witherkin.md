Description: Witherkin are rare among the undead, corpses reanimated by necrotic magic that somehow retain their minds. Their flesh is cold, gray, and slowly decaying, often covered in scars, stitches, or crude reinforcements to slow the inevitable rot. Eyes glow faintly with pale necrotic light, and their voices carry a hollow rasp. Unlike mindless undead, Witherkin can think, plan, and speak, though they carry none of their former memories. Their movements are deliberate but heavy, and they radiate a faint aura of wrongness to the living. While they no longer require regular food, they must regularly consume raw flesh to maintain their physical cohesion, though they do so with control rather than compulsion.

Culture: Witherkin are extremely rare. They tend to be solitary or form small bands, sometimes leading packs of mindless undead. Many become mercenaries or assassins using their unnatural resilience to gain advantage in dangerous roles. The living fear and shun them, forcing most Witherkin to live on the edges of society or in hidden necropolises. Some embrace their undead nature fully, ruling over lesser undead, while others resist their darker urges and seek purpose beyond slaughter.

Other: Template overlays existing race; retains all affinities except where contradicted. Weakness to fire damage, any fire damage taken prevents their resurrection roll until after their next long rest. When reduced to 0 HP, roll 1d20: on 11+, they instead drop to 1 HP. This can occur up to 5 times per long rest. Immune to disease and poison. Does not age naturally. Gains +2 Constitution, -2 Dexterity, -1 Charisma. Resistance to necrotic damage. Vulnerable to radiant damage.

Witherkin Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 1d8 piercing damage + 1d4 necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 10 + proficiency bonus + Strength or Dexterity modifier) or become infected with Rot Infection. Witherkin can choose whether their bite carries the infection. Necrotic damage dealt by this bite restores vitality to the Witherkin equal to the necrotic damage rolled. Each subsequent bite on the same creature increases the DC by 2, this resets after 2 hours of not being bitten.
