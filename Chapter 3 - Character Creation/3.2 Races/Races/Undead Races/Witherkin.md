Description: Witherkin are rare among the undead, corpses reanimated by necrotic forces that somehow retain a mind. Flesh is cold, gray, and slowly decaying, often stitched, scarred, or braced to delay the inevitable. Pale necrotic light pools in the eyes and the voice carries a hollow rasp. Memory of the former life is gone, but reason, speech, and intent remain. Movements are deliberate and heavy, and the living sense a wrongness in their presence. They do not require ordinary food, yet must periodically consume raw flesh to maintain cohesion, a managed necessity rather than an uncontrollable compulsion.

Culture: Witherkin are exceedingly rare and tend to live alone or in tight bands that sometimes command packs of mindless dead. Many sell endurance for coin as mercenaries, wardens, or assassins, leveraging resilience where fear would stop the living. Shunned by most societies, they keep to margins, hidden ossuaries, or forgotten tunnels. Some embrace rulership over lesser undead; others choose strict codes to hold darker urges in check and seek work that grants purpose beyond slaughter. Within their small circles, debts are recorded, promises are kept, and betrayal is answered without spectacle.

Other:
- Template: Apply these traits to a corpse of any playable race; retain base affinities and features except where contradicted here.
- Undead Nature: You do not need air, food, drink, or sleep. You do not age naturally. You are immune to disease and poison.
- Necrotic Ward: You have resistance to Necrotic damage and vulnerability to Radiant damage.
- Fire Fragility: Any Fire damage you take suppresses your Resurrection Roll trait until after your next long rest.
- Resurrection Roll: When reduced to 0 Health, roll 1d20. On 11 or higher, you instead drop to 1 Health. This can occur up to 5 times per long rest.
- Flesh Maintenance: If you go 7 consecutive days without consuming raw flesh, you gain 1 level of exhaustion each day thereafter until you feed; this exhaustion from hunger is removed immediately when you feed.
- Steadfast but Slowed: Apply the listed speed reduction; retain other movement types from the base race if present.

Witherkin Bite  
Melee attack, reach 5 ft, one target. On a hit, 1d8 piercing damage plus 1d4 necrotic damage. You restore Vitality equal to the necrotic damage rolled. The target must succeed on a CON save, DC 10 + your Proficiency Bonus + your STR or DEX modifier, or contract Rot Infection. You choose at the time of the bite whether your bite carries Rot Infection. Each subsequent bite you land on the same creature within 2 hours increases this save DC by 2; the escalation resets after 2 hours without being bitten.
