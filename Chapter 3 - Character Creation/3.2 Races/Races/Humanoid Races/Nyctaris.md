- Description: Nyctaris are beings of pure shadow.  They live in the shadow realm, Nyxrealm, a dark mirror of the real world, and rarely come out. Nyctaris generally look like the silhouette of a man or woman with glowing eyes. The color of their eyes shows the mood they are in.

- Culture: Nyctaris are trouble makers constantly messing with people in the real world. They aren’t typically very dangerous as they cannot directly harm or touch anything in the real world but they can bring creatures or objects into their world and then harm them. 
    
- Other: Nyctaris cannot be hurt in the real world but in their dimension they can be injured, this means in order to hurt others they must first make themselves vulnerable. (As an action you can enter the shadow realm making yourself invincible to all damage but you cannot deal damage, leaving the shadow realm consumes your entire turn no matter how many actions you have remaining. This ability does not function in an area with a light level over dim.)  Darkvision up to 150 ft.
