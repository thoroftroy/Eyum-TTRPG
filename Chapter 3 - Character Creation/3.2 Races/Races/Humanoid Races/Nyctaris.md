Description: Nyctaris are beings of pure shadow, silhouettes given mind and motion. In their native Nyxrealm—the lightless echo of the material world—their bodies ride the edges of form like smoke pinned to a shape. In the mortal world they appear as the outline of a person with luminous eyes that float in the darkness of their face, and the air seems to dim around them as if light forgets to fully arrive. Their contours ripple when they move, a hush of not-quite-sound tracking each step. Fabrics hang on them like draped night; ornaments are matte, braided cords and black glass beads that don’t catch the eye. The hue of their eyes signals mood with unsettling clarity, a language even strangers learn quickly.

Culture: Nyctaris treat mischief as mapmaking. They slip between planes to test boundaries, confuse the unkind, and collect secrets in places no one else can reach. In the world of light they cannot directly harm or touch, so their pranks are distractions, swapped signs, stolen echoes of footsteps—yet in the Nyxrealm they are hunters and wardens. Bands of Nyctaris gather where shadows pool deepest, mirroring streets and forests that exist above, building quiet courts where disputes are settled by cleverness rather than cruelty. They value subtlety, patience, and the craft of disappearing at the perfect moment. Outsiders often meet them as tricksters, but beneath the teasing is a hard rule: power must be paid for with risk. To harm another truly, a Nyctaris must cross fully into danger, and most reserve that choice for tyrants and oath-breakers.

Other:
- Umbral Sight: Darkvision up to 150 ft. You have advantage on Spot checks made in dim light or darkness.
- Nyxwalk: As an action, you step into the Nyxrealm. While there you are invulnerable to all damage and effects originating in the material world, but you cannot deal damage or physically affect the material world. Leaving the Nyxrealm consumes your entire turn. This ability does not function in areas brighter than dim light.
- Shadowmeld: While in dim light or darkness, you have advantage on Stealth checks, and creatures have disadvantage on Spot or Search checks to find you.
- Shade Step: While in dim light or darkness, you may teleport up to 10 ft to an unoccupied space you can see as a bonus action.
- Umbral Lure: Once per short rest, as an action, choose one creature within 15 ft that is in dim light or darkness. It must succeed on a WIS save (DC 12 + Proficiency Bonus + CHA mod) or be pulled partially into the Nyxrealm until the end of your next turn. While lured, the creature cannot affect or be affected by creatures other than you, and its movement speed is reduced to 5 ft.
- Light Averse: You are vulnerable to radiant damage, and while in bright light you have -1 Base Acc and disadvantage on Stealth checks.
