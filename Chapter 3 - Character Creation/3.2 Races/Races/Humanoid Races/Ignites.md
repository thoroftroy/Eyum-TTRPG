Description: Ignites appear mostly human at a glance, tall, wiry, and radiant with heat, but up close their skin shimmers with living embers. Hair tends to be coarse and dark, the ends sometimes smoldering after exertion, and eyes burn a steady orange that never quite looks natural. The air around them wavers in faint mirage ripples, and cloth worn too long scorches at collars and cuffs. Veins glow when their emotions spike or mana surges, etching slow, molten lines along the neck and forearms. Their movements are measured rather than frantic, like banked coals that can flash to white heat in an instant. Voices are low and even, carrying a dry rasp, and the scent of warm stone or smoke clings to them after any fight or spellcasting.

Culture: Ignites are a people defined by restraint and ritual. They dwell in the Ember Wastes where obsidian ridges, glass dunes, and lava vents dictate travel, shelter, and trade. Each person bears a Core Spark, a sacred metaphor for self-mastery, and most rites revolve around controlling, not flaunting, power. Duels are tests of patience more than fury, and apprentices learn to build a fire that lasts the night before they are trusted to cast openly. Outsiders often mistake their silence for hostility, yet the Ignite ethic is simple: act only with purpose, burn only what must be burned, protect the flame that protects you. They rarely campaign, build empires, or proselytize, preferring compact domes of fused glass, shifting camps over warm stone, and pilgrimage routes that follow seasonal heat. Leaving the Wastes is uncommon and risky; even the strongest quickly learn the world beyond is not built for bodies that run hot. When Ignites do travel, they serve as purifiers, ruin-scouts, plague-burners, and wardens against creeping corruption, returning home to recite long, spare accounts of what was cleansed and why.
