- Description: Ignites appear mostly human at a glance, tall, wiry, and radiant with energy, but on closer inspection, their bodies shimmer with flickering embers beneath their skin. Their hair is coarse and dark, but often smolders at the ends, and their eyes burn with a quiet, steady orange light. The heat of an Ignite’s body is tangible, clothes worn too long will char or crisp around their collar. Their veins glow faintly when they exert themselves, and the air around them distorts in mirage-like waves. Despite their warmth, they are not fiery in demeanor, but often slow-moving, intense, and unshakable.
    
- Culture: Ignites dwell only within the Ember Wastes, a desolate volcanic region shaped by flame and wind. Bound by ancient elemental laws, they cannot survive long outside their homeland. Within it, their society thrives in shifting obsidian domes, where ritual, solitude, and firebinding dominate their way of life. An Ignite’s identity is tied to their "Core Spark", a spiritual concept representing their inner fire. Their people believe action must be deliberate and refined, and that recklessness is the mark of an unstable flame. Though not hostile, they are insular and distant, often ignoring travelers unless provoked or intrigued. Creation is not their goal; instead, they practice controlled destruction, scouring ruins, purging corruption, and honing fire as a purifying force. They rarely speak, and when they do, it is with smoldering intensity.
    
- Other: Immune to all heat and fire damage. Vulnerable to cold damage (takes 50% more). When in a location that is under ~70 degrees fahrenheit for more than 1 hour you gain 1 level of exhaustion per day (this extension cannot be regained by resting unless you enter an area that is hot enough (>70 degrees))
