- Description: Lumari are graceful, luminous humanoids with smooth, human-like features and radiant skin that glows faintly, especially in darkness. Their complexions range from golden bronze to moonlit pearl, always emitting a subtle sheen as though kissed by light. Their eyes are fully colored, white, silver, gold, or amber, and seem to shimmer even when still. Hair ranges from pure white to warm yellow and light rose hues, often worn long and loosely flowing. While physically similar to humans in build and movement, Lumari possess an almost ethereal elegance in how they walk, speak, and carry themselves, as if always aware of being watched by the sun.
    
- Culture: The Lumari are devoted to light, not merely as an element, but as a principle. They believe illumination reveals truth, purifies the soul, and connects the physical world to the divine. Their cities are built around great crystal towers that capture and refract sunlight, and their rituals often begin at dawn or high noon. Lumari value clarity, honesty, and purposeful living. Deception is deeply frowned upon, while acts of guidance or mercy are celebrated. However, their ideals can turn rigid, they sometimes mistake personal conviction for moral authority. Most Lumari serve as scholars, judges, priests, or healers, with radiant rune-magic passed through bloodlines and scripture. Despite their brilliance, Lumari can be socially distant, struggling to connect with more chaotic or cynical cultures. Still, they believe it is their duty to lead others into the light, not through conquest, but by example.
