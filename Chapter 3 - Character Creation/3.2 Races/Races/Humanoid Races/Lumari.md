Description: Lumari are graceful, luminous humanoids with smooth, humanlike features and skin that carries its own quiet glow, brightest in darkness. Complexions range from sun-bronze to moonlit pearl, always with a soft sheen like light resting just beneath the surface. Their eyes are fully colored in whites, silvers, golds, or ambers, still yet shimmering, and hair runs from pure white through warm yellow to faint rose, most often worn long and unbound so it can catch and scatter light. In motion they appear curated rather than casual, shoulders square, steps light, and speech measured, as though public grace were a daily discipline. Even at rest there is an awareness about them, the sense that they place themselves where light would show them best.

Culture: To the Lumari, light is principle as much as element. They build cities around crystal towers that seize and refract the sun, and their rites set dawn and high noon as sacred hours. Illumination is a moral act: to reveal truth, to cleanse, to connect the seen world to what lies above it. Clarity, honesty, and purposeful living are the virtues most often taught; deception is a failure of character, mercy a form of guidance. These ideals can harden into rigor when unexamined, and Lumari sometimes mistake personal conviction for rightful authority. Many serve as scholars, judges, priests, healers, or keepers of radiant rune-magic passed through scripture and lineage. Hospitality is real but formal, and their distance can feel like pride to quicker, rougher cultures. Their preferred leadership is by example, lives tuned to steadiness and care so others can step into the light without being forced.

Other:
- Lumen Aura: You emit dim light in a 5-ft radius at all times. You can suppress or resume this until the start of your next turn as a bonus action.
- Sunflash: Once per short rest, as an action you release a burst of radiance. Creatures of your choice within 10 ft that can see you must succeed on a CON save (DC 12 + Proficiency Bonus + WIS mod) or be blinded until the end of your next turn. On a success, they have âˆ’1 Base Acc until the end of their next turn.
- Daystride: While in bright natural light, your flying speed increases to 50 ft and you can hover. If you leave bright light, this ends at the start of your next turn.
- Eyes of Light: You can end the blinded condition on yourself as a bonus action once per combat.
