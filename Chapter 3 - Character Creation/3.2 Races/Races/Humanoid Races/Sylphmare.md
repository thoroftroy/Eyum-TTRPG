Description: Sylphmares are tall, gaunt humanoids with ashen gray skin and hollow eyes that carry a dim, exhausted glow. Their faces hold the beauty of statues left out in the rain, smooth features thinned by worry, lips pale, cheeks a touch sunken. Hair falls in limp strands of silver, white, or faded black, rarely styled beyond a loose tie, as if any extra effort would cost too much. Every motion comes slow and deliberate, shoulders settling before they move, fingers hovering over a task for a heartbeat as if deciding whether it is worth doing. Rooms feel quieter when a Sylphmare enters, not colder in temperature, but hushed, the way a house sounds after bad news. Their clothes favor muted cloth, threadbare coats and long wraps that hang like tired shadows, charms of bone or dull glass stitched on more out of ritual than pride. They look like they have just woken from a nightmare, or never quite left it, carrying its weight in their posture and in the way their eyes flick to the darkest corner first.

Culture: Sylphmare settlements are thin on the map, a scattering of wayhouses and grottoes where silence is law and lanterns are shaded. Most live alone or in very small circles, speaking rarely, sharing what they have without ceremony. From childhood they are taught that life is short and heavy, that endurance is a craft made of small choices, eat a little, rest a little, help when you can. Joy does not come easily, so they do not chase it, instead they practice honesty, plain words, and a refusal to promise what they cannot give. Art exists, but it is spare and piercing, poems like open windows on winter nights, songs that do not rise above a murmur, carvings that leave more stone untouched than cut. Magic turns inward, illusions and mind shaping used to show others what despair looks like from the inside, not to frighten, but to make truth visible. Outsiders pity them, or fear them, or try to fix them, none of which a Sylphmare asks for. What they value is presence, someone who will sit the watch through a long night, say what is real, and leave when the dawn finally shows. When they do fight, they fight like people who have made peace with loss, steady, tireless, and without bluff.
