- Description: Sylphmares are tall, gaunt humanoids with ashen gray skin, sunken features, and hollow eyes that flicker with a dim, exhausted glow. Their movements are slow, deliberate, and often appear fatigued, as if every action is burdened by unseen weight. Their hair is limp, often shades of silver, white, or faded black, and their expressions rarely shift from blank weariness. Despite their physical beauty and grace, Sylphmares always appear like they’ve just woken from a nightmare they can’t remember, or worse, never escaped. Their presence chills a room, not with temperature, but with a quiet, inescapable heaviness.
    
- Culture: Sylphmare society is sparse and fragmented. Most live alone, or in quiet clusters where silence is considered sacred. They do not build cities, nor do they gather for celebration. Every Sylphmare is born knowing their time is short, and they feel it keenly from their first breath. Their emotional baseline is a kind of quiet dread, they are not suicidal, but life itself is a burden they must endure. They do not hate others, but they find joy difficult to understand and often feel alienated by the vibrancy of other races. When they speak, it is with honesty and raw, unfiltered bleakness. Many become poets, prophets, or seers, not because they seek wisdom, but because they are always looking for a reason to continue. Their art is haunting, their magic often focused on illusions or mind-affecting forces that mirror their internal despair. Some outsiders pity them, others fear them, but few forget them.
