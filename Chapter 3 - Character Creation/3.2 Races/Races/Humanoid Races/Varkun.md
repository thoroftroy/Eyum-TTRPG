- Description: Varkun are striking, infernally-touched humanoids with deep red, burnt copper, or slate-gray skin. Thick, curling horns rise from their brows, each set unique in pattern and shape, and a slender, muscular tail extends from their lower spine, swaying with every shift in mood. Their eyes glow with a steady internal fire, often gold, crimson, or molten orange, and faint trails of smoke drift from their skin during moments of rage, fear, or magic use. Their presence exudes heat and tension, like a storm just on the edge of breaking. Some decorate their horns with metal rings or etch them with sigils, while others let them remain unadorned as symbols of raw, untamed will.
    
- Culture: Marked by bloodlines few understand and many fear, Varkun have long lived on the margins of society. Mistrusted by others for their infernal heritage, they have become experts at surviving in harsh environments, both social and literal. Most Varkun live in tightly bound clans or urban enclaves, where reputation and cunning matter more than law. Within these groups, loyalty is everything. A Varkun will fight, lie, or die for their kin without hesitation, but betrayal is never forgiven, and vengeance becomes ritual. They value cleverness, adaptability, and power earned through struggle. While some adopt mercenary lifestyles or infiltrate positions of influence, others turn inward, seeking mastery over magic and manipulation alike. Though outsiders often call them deceivers or devils, few Varkun consider themselves evil, just pragmatic, passionate, and tired of being hunted.
