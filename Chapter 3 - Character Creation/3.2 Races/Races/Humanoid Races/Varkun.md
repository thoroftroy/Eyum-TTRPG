Description: Varkun are infernally touched and unmistakable at a glance. Skin runs deep red, burnt copper, or slate gray, and heat seems to pool beneath it in faint, ember like motes that brighten with anger or spellwork. Thick, curling horns rise from the brow, each set uniquely banded, ridged, or swept, some etched with sigils, some heavy with rings, others left raw as a statement of will. A long, muscular tail balances every step and telegraphs mood by lash or slow coil. Eyes glow from within, molten golds and crimsons steady as banked coals, and in moments of stress a thin smoke threads from shoulders and jaw. Their frames are lean and tendoned rather than bulky, built for hard streets, quick climbs, and the kind of stillness that precedes a decisive move. Clothes favor layered leathers and metal trims that take heat without warping, pockets for chalk and coin, blades worn close to the ribs, and a single clean symbol of clan cut where it will not be missed.

Culture: Varkun history is written at the edges of other peoples’ cities, in alleys, border forts, caravan yards, and markets that forget names as easily as they take coin. Mistrusted for their bloodlines and blamed for fires they did not start, they learned to survive by reading rooms quickly, by building clans that hold tighter than law, and by turning reputation into armor. Within an enclave, loyalty is currency and promise, any Varkun will lie, fight, or vanish for kin, and betrayal is answered in ritual, names struck from ledgers, marks burned cold. Leadership is earned by competence, not birth, the planner who keeps a crew fed leads until someone better proves it. Children are taught three crafts, one to eat, one to escape, one to rise, and the wise keep two lives, one that smiles in daylight and one that moves at the hour when debts are paid. Many hire on as mercenaries, warders, fixers, or brokers, others dive into arcane study to master the fires that cling to their bones. They are not saints, they are not devils, they are pragmatic, proud, and tired of being hunted, and when a Varkun gives their word under witness, they keep it, because a broken oath is a clan’s shame.

Other:
- Fireblood Resilience: You have resistance to fire damage.
- Heat Mirage: The air around you shimmers with heat. Adjacent enemies have -1 Base Acc on attack rolls against you.
- Horned Rush: You have a natural horn attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. If you move at least 10 ft straight toward a target before hitting with this attack, add +1d4 base melee damage to that attack.
- Tail Balance: Your tail aids balance and quick movement. You have advantage on Acrobatics checks to keep footing, cross narrow surfaces, or avoid falling. Once per turn, you may use your tail to manipulate a small object you can reach, such as opening an unlocked latch or retrieving a stowed item.
