Description: Snerin are squat, wide bodied humanoids built like press frames. Skin is dense gray, matte in bright light, almost stone polished in low light. Eyes are bulbous and mirror dark, adapted to drink detail from gloom. Their scalps carry ridges from brow to nape like carved strakes, ears lie tight to the skull, noses stay flat and practical. Hands are thick fingered with chisel like nails, palms calloused where tools kick and vibrate. They move with an efficient, mechanical grace, steps placed to waste nothing, shoulders and elbows angling to keep leverage clean. Dress is function first, layered work leathers, reinforced aprons, utility belts heavy with bit sets, calipers, and greasecloths, and many integrate small mechanical assists into armor plates, spring braces at knees or shock straps at wrists.

Culture: Snerin build deep and think deeper. They favor volcanic tunnels, obsidian seams, and ruin strata where the world’s heat and pressure can be measured and used. Communities are insulated, not cruel, but cautious, the surface and its changeable peoples are variables to be contained. Value is proved in blueprints that hold, machines that start every time, tools that outlive their makers. Songs carry memory, long work chants and epics timed to the stroke rate of hammers and drills, each verse encoding a caution or a fix. Outsiders are tolerated at arm’s length, every claim weighed against tested logic, every bargain checked twice. To a Snerin, worth is what you leave behind, useful, beautiful, and enduring. Magic is a means, woven into instruments and rigs, never flash when a fixture will do.
