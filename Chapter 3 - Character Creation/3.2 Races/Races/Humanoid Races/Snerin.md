- Description: Snerin are stout, wide-bodied humanoids with dense gray skin, bulbous reflective eyes adapted to low light, and ridged scalps that run from brow to neck like carved stone. Their ears are small and tucked close to the head, while their noses are flat and practical. Snerin hands are thick-fingered and rough, with nails like chisels and palms used to steady tools against vibrating machinery. Their bodies are squat but powerful, with an almost mechanical grace, every movement efficient and precise. They often wear utility belts, reinforced leathers, or armor integrated with mechanical enhancements, and their clothing tends to be function-first and heavily layered.
    
- Culture: Snerin culture is built deep into the earth and deeper into tradition. Suspicious of the surface and its unpredictable peoples, Snerin form tightly insulated communities in volcanic tunnels, obsidian mines, or ancient subterranean ruins. Their greatest values are knowledge, function, and endurance, measured in blueprints, working machines, and tools that outlive their makers. They pass down stories through oral epics sung during labor, encoding wisdom and warnings in every stanza. Outsiders are tolerated but rarely trusted, and every word from a stranger is weighed against long-established logic. Snerin believe true worth is proven through action and craft, not charisma or appearance. To them, a life well-lived is one that leaves behind something useful, beautiful, and enduring. Magic, when used, is often woven into tools or machines, always practical, rarely flashy.
