Description: Sandmen are psionic dream-walkers. Their skin runs pale sand to ash-blue; eyes are milky or pearl-black with thin vertical pupils. Fingers are long and cool to the touch. Across the lineage there are clear variants: some look almost human with faint facial ridges and smooth scalps; others bear short cranial tendrils and soft, split palates; the most cephalid have small prehensile facial tendrils and a flexible, cartilaginous jaw. Their movements are quiet and economical, and they react to sound and scent as if “reading” the room. Tools favor clean lines and padded grips for long study sessions; armor is close-fit and unadorned.

Culture: Sandman have no unified nation or creed. Most Sandmen live scattered through big cities where crowds and constant sleep make work easy. They hire out as information brokers, interrogators, wardens of the rich (ending nightmares), or mercenaries who “solve” problems in the dead of night. They prefer leverage over loyalty and keep rotating safehouses, false names, and clean paper trails. Cooperation is temporary; if a cell forms, it’s for a job, not a tribe.

Other:
- Dream Entry (1/Short Rest): As an Action, target a sleeping or unconscious creature within 30 ft that you can see. It must make a Wisdom Save (DC 15). On a failure, you enter its dream for 1 minute. While inside, you can: 
	- (a) communicate telepathically and learn one surface fear or desire of your choice; 
	- (b) steady the mind, removing Frightened from the target upon waking. 
	- (c) frighten the creature, giving them the Frightened condition for the next 3 hours
- Telepathy: Communicate mentally with a creature within 60 ft that shares a language with you.
- Psionic Bolt (1/Short Rest): As an Action, make a mental assault at 30 ft; the target makes a Constitution Save (DC 14), taking 2d8 Psychic on a failure, half on success.
- Lucid Mind: Advantage on saving throws against sleep, charm, and fear.
- Sleep Cycle: You require only 2 hours of trance-like rest to gain the benefits of a full rest, but if you go 48 hours without rest you take -1 to all rolls until you complete your rest (stacks to -3).
- Variant Physiology: You may choose one of the following at character creation (reflecting how far along the cephalid-humanoid spectrum you are):
- Humanoid-Leaning: Gain +1 AC while not wearing heavy armor; when you roll to maintain concentration, add +2 to the roll.
- Cephalid-Leaning: Gain a Swim Speed 30 ft, can hold breath for 10 minutes, and have a Tentacle Lash natural weapon (1d6 bludgeoning, reach 10 ft; counts as a finesse weapon).
- Veil-Step: Once per Long Rest, as a Bonus Action you teleport 30 ft to a space you can see.
