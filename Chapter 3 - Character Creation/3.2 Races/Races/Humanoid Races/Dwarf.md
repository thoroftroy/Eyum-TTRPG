Description: Dwarves of Eyum are compact and immovable, built like the joists of a fortress. Barrel chests carry thick corded muscle, legs are short but coiled with power, and hands are square and calloused from tool and tongs. Beards are a ledger you can read at a glance, braided with metal clasps, polished stones, and rune-tags that record clan, craft, and deeds. Skin runs from ash brown to ruddy copper, eyes catch light like ore veined through stone, and even at four feet a dwarf stands with the grounded presence of a peak. They work in heat and smoke without complaint, withstand pressure and poison that would drop taller folk, and seem to settle into any space like they were always meant to be there. Their clothing favors layered work-leather, aprons dark with oil, and belts heavy with chisels and punches. Even at rest they keep a tool in hand, a file smoothing an edge that no one else could feel.

Culture: Dwarven society is laid deep into bedrock, cavern-cities carved where mountain hearts beat warm, and long halls bored under scorched plains where the bed of the world runs close. Every cut channel, each engraved rune, is an echo of the Prime Stone, the first pattern from which all craft descends. Speech is measured and spare, feeling is held tight and given slowly, but once a bond is struck it is iron, and a broken vow is remembered for generations. Councils are led by masters of craft, by runesmiths and metallurgists whose signatures are as binding as law. Feasts mark completed spans of wall, a well struck exactly where water would be, a vein opened without collapse. Rituals of honor turn hands to the workbench and eyes to the ledger, family names joined to tools that outlive their owners. Grudges are not tantrums, they are records, and reconciliation takes the same patience and pressure as laying a keystone. Yet a dwarf’s respect is not limited to stone or steel, anything worth building earns it, a friendship, a promise, a legacy.
