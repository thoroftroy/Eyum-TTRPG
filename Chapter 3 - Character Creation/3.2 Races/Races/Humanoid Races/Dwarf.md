- Description: Dwarves of Eyum are stout, sturdy folk with barrel chests, thick limbs, and hands calloused from a lifetime of labor. Their faces are typically adorned with long, carefully maintained beards, woven with charms, stones, or rune-etched clasps that signify clan, profession, or honor. Their skin ranges from ash-brown to ruddy copper, and their eyes often shine like polished ore. Dwarves rarely grow taller than four feet, yet they carry themselves with the grounded presence of a mountain. Despite their size, their resilience is unmatched, and their bodies can endure extreme pressure, toxins, and temperature with minimal complaint.
    
- Culture: Dwarven society is rooted deep, both metaphorically and literally. Living in cavern-cities carved into the hearts of mountains or beneath scorched plains, Dwarves dedicate their lives to work, whether in stonecraft, metallurgy, runesmithing, or alchemy. Labor is not merely survival, it is reverence. Every hammer stroke, every carved rune is an echo of the Prime Stone, the mythical source from which all craftsmanship flows. Dwarves speak little of emotion but feel deeply; they form bonds slowly but fiercely, and a betrayed dwarf will never forget. Their reverence for the old ways leads to long-lasting grudges, but also to traditions of unmatched craftsmanship, family honor, and ritual. Above all, a dwarf respects what is built, be it a fortress, a friendship, or a legacy.
