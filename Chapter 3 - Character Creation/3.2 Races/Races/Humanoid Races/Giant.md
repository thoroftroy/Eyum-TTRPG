- Description: Giants are massive humanoids, typically standing between 10 to 20 feet tall, with rugged, thick skin that ranges from pale granite to obsidian black. Their bodies are slabs of muscle, naturally sculpted by their sheer size and durability. Hair is minimal or entirely absent, and their faces, while humanlike in shape, are stretched and squared by the proportions of a much larger form. Every motion carries titanic weight, and their voices resonate like distant thunder. Though simple in appearance, there is an ancient vitality in a Giant’s eyes, the kind only found in beings who live as long as mountains.
    
- Culture: Giants exist solely in the war-blasted reaches of the Crystal Veil, where towering cliffs and sprawling wastelands serve as their ancestral battlegrounds. Here, family names define identity, and combat is not merely a tradition, it is their language. Giants are constantly engaged in conflict with one another and with their hostile environment, but these battles are rarely driven by hatred. To a Giant, war is joy, and death is honor. A duel between Giants is more akin to sport than vengeance, and laughter often accompanies even the most violent encounters. Their clan-holds are decorated with trophies of fallen kin, not as memorials but as badges of legacy. Giants respect power, endurance, and boldness, and often treat smaller races with a mix of amused tolerance and blunt condescension.

Can crush stone and wood effortlessly; their strikes count as siege-grade unarmed attacks when unarmed (1d10 instead of 1d4 for unarmed attacks). Known to consume gems and precious minerals for sustenance (You can eat gems and it counts as food).
