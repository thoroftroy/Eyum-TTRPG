Description: Giants are titanic humanoids, their skin rugged and thick in tones from pale granite to obsidian black. Muscle sits on muscle, a body shaped by scale and endurance rather than training, hair sparse or absent, faces stretched and squared by a larger geometry. Every step lands with felt weight, every small motion carries leverage that would topple a cart if carelessly placed. Voices roll like distant thunder and hold a patient cadence, the rhythm of long lives measured in storms and stonefalls. However simple their silhouettes may seem, their eyes hold an old vitality, a steadiness that comes from standing through centuries of weather, war, and want. They wear what lasts, hide and chain, slabs of woven cloth, iron rings hammered to fit knuckles the size of bricks, trophies that clang when they laugh.

Culture: Giants live for the clash, not out of hatred but because fighting feels right in their bones. They wrestle for courtship, arm-crack for wagers, and settle arguments with bouts called on the spot, a circle of stones, a few shouted rules, and a crowd that loves a clean hit. Plans longer than a day make their heads hurt, so they favor simple truths, eat when hungry, sleep when tired, fight when challenged, help kin when called. They admire raw strength, loud courage, and a good joke, and they measure respect in bruises traded without whining. Giants are blunt to the point of rudeness, bad at lying, worse at scheming, and proud of it. They hoist trophies because they are shiny or heavy, not because they are rare, and they tell stories with their scars more than their words. Toward smaller folk they are boisterously tolerant, calling them “little cousins,” teasing them, lifting them out of harm’s way with one hand, and forgetting that doors and roofs break under giant fingers. Their few laws are easy to remember, speak plainly, keep your promises, don’t strike the weak unless they ask for it, laugh after the bout, and share the stew.
