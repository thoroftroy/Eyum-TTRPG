- Description: Aurians bear an uncanny resemblance to humans, but their unearthly features mark them as something more. Always pale and elegant, their skin carries a soft glow under moonlight, and their eyes burn a vibrant red, never dim, never dull. While the men of their kind tend toward powerful physiques with sculpted muscle, the women are usually lithe, with a glass-like fragility that belies hidden strength. There is a cold intensity in their presence, as if they see the world as something to be analyzed, not embraced. Their voices are calm and level, yet carry the weight of assured authority.
    
- Culture: Aurians live in isolated arcane enclaves or ivory towers built upon forgotten ruins. Obsessed with runes and their boundless potential, they dedicate entire generations to mastering the script of the world. Knowledge is sacred, power is inevitable, and sacrifice is expected. Each Aurian is taught that their lineage was chosen for greatness, and this belief fosters both brilliance and arrogance. Their cities are ruled by powerful hierarchs, Runemasters whose will is law, and whose word shapes reality. Although disciplined, Aurian society is ruthless beneath its order. Scholars sabotage rivals through clever arcane loopholes, and even blood relatives may compete to master the secrets buried in their bones. They view most other races as distractions from their pursuit of knowledge, and while not overtly hostile, few Aurians would trust anyone not shaped by the same relentless refinement.
