Description: Aurians resemble humans at a distance, but up close their symmetry is too exact and their pallor catches moonlight with a faint inner glow. Eyes are a constant, vivid red, set beneath calm brows that rarely betray emotion. Features trend elegant and spare, cheekbones cut fine, hands steady and precise. The men often build dense, sculpted muscle as a deliberate discipline, while the women tend toward a tensile, glass-like lightness that conceals hard strength. Their movements are economical, every gesture measured as if it were an equation being solved. Voices are level and unhurried, the cadence of teachers and magistrates, and even casual speech can feel like a ruling delivered from a dais. These traits align with their recorded baseline, pale skin that glows softly in moonlight, ever-red eyes, and a bearing that reads analytical rather than warm. Their skin is usually a tan brown and their hair usually a light gray or white. 

Culture: Aurians seclude themselves in arcane towers raised atop ruined foundations or in rune-wreathed cloisters that overlook the old world. They measure life in treatises and experiments, copying the script of reality until it bends for them. Children memorize sigils before histories, and households keep family grimoires that pass from hand to hand like titles. Power is administered by Runemasters whose edicts set the rhythm of trade, defense, and study. The surface order is strict and shining, but beneath it lies a competitive austerity, scholars test rivals with cleverly framed bindings, apprentices argue precedence in dueling circles, and kin compete for the right to engrave their names in the master indexes. Outsiders are tolerated as variables to control for, not partners to trust, which is why Aurian diplomacy is formal, contractual, and often brief. Their recorded entry emphasizes the same pillars, isolated enclaves, generational obsession with runes, hierarchical rule by Runemasters, and a disciplined society that can turn ruthless behind the facade of order.
