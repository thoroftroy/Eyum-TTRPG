Description: Broodweavers are pale, smooth-skinned humanoids with a faint wet sheen, as if the air never quite dries on them. Four glossy black eyes watch from a calm, unreadable face, two set where a human’s would be and two smaller ones high on the brow. Their hair grows in saturated colors, cobalt, poison green, bruise purple, and is often worn short to keep it from sticking. At a glance they look soft, but up close tiny setae give their palms and fingers a subtle grip, and their skin smells faintly of clean resin. The unsettling part is not the look, it is the way their attention divides without effort, one pair of eyes tracking a room while the other fixes on a single pulse or gesture. When they are stressed or focused, pearly seams open along the ribs or spine and a bead of living gel extrudes, shaping into a skittering broodling that drops to the floor and scurries off at an unspoken command.

Culture: There is no single homeland and no unified creed. Most Broodweavers live where numbers hide them best, dense cities, dock alleys, stacked slums, service tunnels. They rent rooms under simple names, take practical work, and keep their heads down. The brood does the errands, scouting gutters, climbing vents, and crowding the ankles of a target until nerves fray. Small crews form for short jobs, then disperse before attention sticks. A Broodweaver’s idea of community is simple, keep the nest dry, keep the food shared, keep the noise down, and if hunters come, move fast and leave nothing that can point back.

Other:
- Four Eyes: You are proficient in Search and Spot.
- Budding, create broodling: As an action, create 1 broodling in an empty space within 5 ft. A broodling lasts 1 minute, then dissolves. If you are unconscious, or if a broodling ends its turn more than 60 ft from you, it dies immediately. You may dismiss any broodling you control as a free action.
	- Brood limit, scales by level: You can have at most 1 + Total Level broodlings active at once. 
	- Hive link: Your broodlings act on your initiative. As a bonus action, issue one command to all broodlings, Move, Attack, Disengage, Hide, or Help. Without a command on your turn they Dodge and remain within 20 ft of you. You always know the location of each broodling within 60 ft.
