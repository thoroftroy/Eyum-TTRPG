- Description: Syrith are tall, alluring humanoids with perfectly symmetrical features and a soft, unnatural glow to their skin. Their eyes are large and luminescent, subtly shifting color with mood and intent, green when pleased, violet when playful, red when angry. Their voices carry a musical resonance that lingers, even in silence. Flowing hair like strands of silk glimmers in unnatural light, and their movements are always deliberate, graceful, and calculated. Some possess delicate, transparent wings reminiscent of dragonflies, which they use not for combat but to enhance their mystique.
    
- Culture: Beneath their charm lies calculation. Syrith culture is built around manipulation as an art form. They live in hidden cliffside temples and underwater spire-cities where hierarchy is shaped not by strength, but by influence. Syrith learn from birth how to control a room with nothing but a smile. To them, trust is a currency, and affection is a weapon. Love, loyalty, and even pain are tools of leverage in a game that never ends. They often serve as emissaries, nobles, or cult leaders, depending on the region. Though they present as carefree and joyful, most Syrith see emotions as levers to be pulled, not truths to be shared. This makes them dangerous allies and mesmerizing enemies. Those who fall under a Syrith's influence often don’t realize it until long after it’s too late.
