- Description: Solari are luminous humanoids, radiant in both presence and form. Their skin shimmers in soft, prismatic hues, tones of gold, pearl, and rose, shifting subtly with movement and mood. Veins of living light pulse beneath the surface, branching like constellations beneath their skin. Their golden eyes gleam with quiet conviction, and their voices hum with an unnatural clarity that feels almost melodic. Though physically solid, Solari possess an otherworldly quality, when gripped by strong emotion, their feet may lift gently from the ground, their bodies carried on flickers of radiant energy. In rare moments of inspiration or fury, they may manifest faint wings of light, ephemeral and purely symbolic, but deeply moving to behold.
    
- Culture: Solari believe they were born to embody a purpose greater than themselves. Each views life as a sacred mission, whether that be to guide, to judge, or to illuminate paths for others. Raised in structured societies founded on ancient philosophies, most Solari are educated in ethics, rhetoric, and elemental law from a young age. They see the world in shades of justice and harmony, and while their intentions are often noble, they struggle with rigidity and moral absolutism. A Solari's greatest strength is their clarity of purpose, but this same strength can make them inflexible or self-righteous. They are natural advisors, counselors, and spiritual leaders, and often become entwined in political or moral debates. Solari rarely lie, rarely falter, and when they do, the shame weighs heavily on their hearts. Light, to a Solari, is not merely brightness, it is truth, responsibility, and legacy.
    
- Other: Solari may levitate up to 5 ft above the ground while experiencing strong emotion (once per short rest, 1 minute duration; movement speed becomes 35 ft and ignores terrain). Emit dim light in a 10-ft radius at all times (can suppress with concentration).
