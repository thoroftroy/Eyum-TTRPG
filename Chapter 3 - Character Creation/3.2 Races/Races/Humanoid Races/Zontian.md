Description: Zontians are graceful humanoids with skin tones ranging from deep charcoal to soft silver, accented by hair of pure white or metallic sheen. Their eyes shimmer with faint, glowing hues, often pale blue, gold, or lavender, giving them an unearthly calm. Their features are symmetrical and delicate, though not frail, and they move with a measured, deliberate grace. While their physiques are comparable to humans, their bearing is one of quiet confidence and self-possession. Clothing is often adorned with natural symbols, intricate beadwork, or dyed fabrics that reflect their spiritual ties.

Culture: Zontian culture is steeped in ritual and harmony, built on an unshakable reverence for the natural and divine. They see themselves not as rulers over the land, but as one part of its balance, responsible for safeguarding the rhythm of life. Spiritual leaders, healers, and keepers of ancient traditions hold deep respect, but Zontians rarely enforce strict hierarchies, status is earned through wisdom and service, not force. Music, chanting, and ceremonial dance are woven into daily life, binding communities in shared purpose. Even in foreign lands, Zontians tend to preserve their customs meticulously, believing that their traditions anchor them against corruption and chaos. Outsiders often seek Zontians for guidance in matters of magic, morality, and spiritual balance, but they can be stern with those who disregard the sanctity of nature. Pale-skinned Zontians are exceedingly rare and revered as symbols of enlightenment, though treated with the same communal respect as all others.
