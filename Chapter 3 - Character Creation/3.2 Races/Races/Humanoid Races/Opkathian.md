Description: Opkathians are wild-blooded humanoids whose skin ranges from vibrant green to deep bark-brown. Their hair is always some shade of brown, from pale hazel to nearly black, often left loose or tied simply for practicality. Their facial features tend toward sharp cheekbones and slightly elongated canines, giving them a feral look. Their bodies are lean and corded with wiry muscle, built for long treks and sudden bursts of movement rather than bulk strength. They often decorate themselves with natural adornments, feathers, carved bone, or woven plant fibers, signifying personal achievements or clan heritage.

Culture: Opkathians live according to the rhythms of the natural world. They do not build cities, carve roads, or enforce laws, preferring to live in small nomadic groups or as solitary wanderers. Hierarchies and political systems are viewed as unnatural cages, and most Opkathians will leave rather than submit to prolonged authority. Their days are filled with hunting, foraging, and quiet observation of the world around them. While they can be deeply loyal companions, they are also slow to form attachments, believing that freedom sometimes requires walking alone. Though they respect life, they are not pacifists, when threatened, they respond with decisive, primal violence. Their philosophy values personal choice above all, and even when they work with others, each Opkathian acts according to their own instincts.
