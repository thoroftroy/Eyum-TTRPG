Description: Opkathians are wild blooded wanderers with skin that runs from bright leaf green to deep bark brown. Hair stays in the brown family, from hazel to near black, usually loose or tied back for work and running. Faces are sharp and lean, canines a touch long, and nails grow as subtle claws that mark bark and catch stone. Bodies are corded rather than bulky, built for distance on rough ground and violent bursts when the choice is fight or flee. They dress in what the land gives, leathers, woven grasses, bone toggles, and feathers, each piece keeping a small story, a hunt, a storm, a crossing. Movement is quiet and economical, heads tilting to listen before they speak, hands reading wind and soil without thinking. They smell like rain and woodsmoke, and when they smile it is quick, the way a fox shows teeth then vanishes into brush.

Culture: Freedom sits at the center of an Opkathian life. They do not raise walls or write laws, they keep to trails that change with water and season, gathering in small bands or traveling alone when the spirit asks for silence. Hierarchy feels like a trap to them, so authority is temporary and earned by the moment, the hunter who knows the river leads at the river, the runner who knows the ridge leads at the ridge. Days fill with hunting, foraging, trading paths, and long watches under open sky. Loyalty is real but slow to form, a bond is proven by miles and winters, not by oaths spoken in a hall. They respect life but do not fear violence, when pressed they end a threat fast and without ceremony. Their creed is simple, choose your own way, answer your instincts, take nothing that cannot be carried or paid back, leave a place no worse than you found it.
