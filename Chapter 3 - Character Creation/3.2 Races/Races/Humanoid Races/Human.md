Description: Humans are the measure most other peoples use to understand variety. Ten humans can stand shoulder to shoulder, each with different skin, hair, scars, posture, and still read as a single kind. Their bodies run the full spread from wiry to broad, their faces carry countless small adaptations to sun, wind, salt, dust, city soot. They cut hair short or wear it long, bind it in cloth or bronze, paint it with ash or oil, and change styles as quickly as seasons turn. Their movements are purposeful when work demands, loose when the day is won, quick to learn new tools, quicker to misuse them into new ones. Human eyes do not glow or shift like some races’, but they hold a stubborn spark that refuses to dim, and when a human decides to keep going, they usually do, even if it means limping, crawling, or laughing while they bleed. Their clothing tells their story, stitched patches, repurposed finds, a festival sash next to a soldier’s buckle, a traveler’s coat lined with notes and maps in the margins.

Culture: Human culture is a thousand overlapping arguments with the world about how to live. River towns teach trade and ferries, dune villages prize water lore and patience, cliff cities love stone and echoing songs, road camps pass news faster than couriers. Some nations raise scholars and engineers, others drill militias, others still grow artists by accident because the streets keep telling stories. Faiths, guilds, clans, and crews braid into identities that change with place and luck. What most humans share is urgency and reach, they will try anything twice, they will steal good ideas and make them work with spare parts, and they will turn a setback into a plan before the dust settles. They argue loudly, forgive slowly, and rally fast under a banner if the reason feels right. In mixed companies, humans often end up as translators between mindsets, the person who says “we can try it” while already tying a rope and checking the wind.
