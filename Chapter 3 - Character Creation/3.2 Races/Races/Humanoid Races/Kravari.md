Description: Kravari are lean, sinewy humanoids with sharp features, dusky red or gray skin, and rigid facial markings that grow more defined with age. Their eyes are narrow and often gold or yellow, and their posture is naturally upright and militaristic. Kravari often wear segmented armor and keep their hair cropped or styled into battle crests. They have small tusks protruding from their lower jaw and subtle claws instead of fingernails.

Culture: The Kravari live in structured, highly disciplined societies. Every Kravari is taught combat strategy, survival, and rhetoric from youth. They value order, precision, and honor in service, and they prize intellect just as highly as strength. Kravari warbands often function more like mobile cities than raiding parties, with engineers, philosophers, and tacticians among their ranks. While often mistrusted due to their aggressive appearance and conquest based history, Kravari can be fiercely loyal allies. They believe power must be earned, and that leadership belongs only to the most competent, regardless of bloodline.
