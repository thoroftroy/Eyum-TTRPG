Description: Halofade have warm yellow skin that always looks sun-lit, pale or golden-blonde hair, and unfocused, lazy half-smiles that make them seem spaced out even when they are paying attention. Their eyes are light-touched, pale amber or milk-gold, and catch faint glints in the dark. Movements are loose and unhurried, like a person walking through a daydream, then suddenly precise when they decide to act. Their clothes favor soft fabrics, light colors, and simple cuts that do not snag when slipping through tight spaces. Most wear thin gloves or wraps to avoid leaving prints when they phase through walls, an old habit that sticks even when unnecessary.

Culture: There is no single homeland. Halofade drift toward big trade roads and cities, places with doors to slip past and crowds to disappear into. They work as couriers, “retrieval specialists”, messengers who never miss a meeting, and scouts who can get eyes anywhere. They are casual about belonging, small flats, borrowed rooms, and rooftop camps are common, and friendships are loose circles built on favors and easy company. They respect quiet competence, clean getaways, and promises kept exactly as spoken. If a Halofade says they will be there, they will be there.

Other:
- Fade Step, misalignment: As a bonus action, you become intangible until the start of your next turn. While intangible you can move through creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain, you cannot end your movement inside an object, if you do, you immediately take 2d6 Force damage and are shunted to the nearest open space. While in this form you are immune to all non-nonmagical damage. You cannot take this action more than once every 5 turns. 
- Anchor Link, swap: As an action, choose a creature or object you can see within 60 ft and place a link on it for 1 minute. As a bonus action while the link lasts, you and the linked target swap positions if both are within 120 ft. The link ends after a swap. You may only create one link per short rest but can swap as many times as you wish while the link exists. 
- Photon Lance: As an action, make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within 300 ft. This attack ignores all cover and has a +5 to hit (as well as your Generic Affinity and Magical Acc). On a hit, the target takes 1d4 Radiant damage. The damage increases by 1d4 every 4 Total Level. You can increase the potency of the Photon Lance using mana, each 20 mana spent will fire an additional beam.

- Soft Step: You have advantage on checks to squeeze through tight spaces and to escape a grapple.
