- Description: Elnars are humanoid beings whose bodies bear the unmistakable mark of nature’s touch. Their skin is textured like bark, subtly ridged and knotted, and it changes color with the seasons, blooming with soft greens and floral pinks in spring, rich golds in autumn, and bare grays or snowy whites in winter. Their hair consists of living leaves, petals, or small blossoms that grow from their scalps, often braided or styled into flowing canopies. Their eyes are deep and mossy green, shining faintly in starlight or moonlight. Long limbs and thorn-tipped fingers give them an otherworldly grace that teeters between playful and eerie.
    
- Culture: Elnars live in symbiosis with the natural world, not as rulers or caretakers, but as playful participants. Their society is rooted in spontaneity and joy. Elnars rarely organize into rigid communities, instead drifting in seasonal bands that migrate across forests, meadows, and rivers. They see the world as a stage for stories, jokes, pranks, and art. Their culture prizes laughter, mischief, and momentary beauty above permanence or discipline. However, their carefree exterior masks a deep instinct to protect nature and each other. When provoked, an Elnar’s vengeance can be slow and poetic, tricking their foes into folly, leading them astray, or binding them into cursed thickets. They have no formal leaders but follow those whose words bloom with charm. Music, mimicry, and ritual dance are vital to Elnar identity, and outsiders who learn their rhythms are welcomed with joy (and possibly a harmless prank or three).
