Description: Elnars are humanoid beings marked by the touch of living forests. Their skin is bark textured, ridged and knotted like young wood, and its color follows the seasons, spring brings pale greens and blush pinks, summer deepens into leaf green, autumn runs to rich gold and copper, winter settles into bare grays and snowy whites. Hair grows as leaves, petals, and small blossoms, often braided into crownlets or combed into long canopies that rustle when the wind turns. Eyes are moss green and catch moonlight with a soft shine. Limbs are long, fingers end in thorn tips that can scratch stone and carve soft wood, and their balance lives somewhere between playful dancer and patient briar. Clothing is light and layered, woven from flax and barkcloth, trimmed in seed beads and pressed flowers, meant to breathe with the body rather than bind it. An Elnar at ease hums with the slow rhythm of sap and stream, an Elnar roused moves with sudden whip quick precision, like a branch snapping back to shape.

Culture: Elnars join the world as participants, not rulers, and their homes are the spaces between roots and river stones, the meadows that shift each year, the groves that remember old fires and new rains. Communities form in bands that follow seasons, spring gatherings in bloom filled clearings, summer circuits along reed beds and bee trails, autumn feasts under lantern gourds, winter vigils where snow thickens the sound. Work is play when done in chorus, stories traded by mimicry and music, pranks teach patience, jokes test pride, art blooms and is allowed to fade. They rarely build rigid towns, they tend living places and mark paths with song lines and wind chimes. Outsiders may mistake this for carelessness, yet Elnars keep fierce loyalties, step between axe and sapling without hesitation, and answer insults with cunning, leading trespassers into dead end thickets, unweaving their plans with misdirection until folly binds them. Leadership is a garden, voices that charm and heal are followed until a new song rises. Ritual dance and call and response drumming carry decisions, and those who learn the rhythm are welcomed, laughter first, lessons after.
