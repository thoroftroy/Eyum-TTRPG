Description: Iceborn are tall, broad shouldered humanoids whose skin holds a pale gray cast and a chill under the palm. In moonlight their bodies pick up faint frostwork, hair lies white as driven snow or the blue of glacier light, and eyes run pale blue to silver with a depth that feels winter quiet. Their builds favor endurance over flash, backs straight, lungs deep, and a measured strength that shows only when needed. Movements are controlled and soft, like snowfall masking a storm, steps set without crunch, hands steady even in bitter wind. Lines of the face are spare, the mouth kept still until speech serves purpose. Their clothing layers wool, fur, and sealant leathers into simple silhouettes that hold heat without weight, belts carry runic slates and etched bone charms, and travel packs are packed with care, a place for everything and nothing wasted. When Iceborn stand watch, they do it as if time were another kind of weather to outlast, quiet, observant, and ready to spend themselves for others.

Culture: Iceborn communities practice warmth inside walls and austerity outside them. Aid comes first, pride after, and no one eats until everyone is found. They believe suffering is expected, not celebrated, and strength is the habit of carrying it without complaint. Leadership looks like guidance, elder runepriests and elemental scholars teaching more than ordering, and disputes cool under ritual before they flare. Their sacred language, Serinite, is studied as scripture and tool, each rune both a word and a prayer, a frost line scratched into the bones of the world. Children learn to breathe slow, to bank their fires, to carve patience into their days. They speak when needed and trust that action explains more clearly than argument. Outsiders often mistake silence for coldness, but within an Iceborn hall the hearth is open, the ledger of help is long, and debts are paid forward. Their heroes are those who endured without spectacle and those who spent their strength quietly so others did not have to.
