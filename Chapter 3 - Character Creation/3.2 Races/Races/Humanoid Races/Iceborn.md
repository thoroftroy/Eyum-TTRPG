- Description: Iceborn are tall, broad-shouldered humanoids with pale gray skin and hair as white as freshly fallen snow. Their bodies are built for endurance, carrying a quiet, frigid power beneath their reserved exteriors. Their skin is cold to the touch, and in low light, it can seem to reflect faint patterns of frost. Their eyes are often pale blue or silver, with a depth that suggests long nights of contemplation under icy stars. Despite their intimidating size, Iceborn move with soft, deliberate grace, like snowfall that hides a frozen storm beneath.
    
- Culture: Iceborn society is a paradox of warmth and austerity. They are fiercely devoted to helping others, often placing the needs of their community above their own comfort, yet they are not driven by hope or faith in the goodness of the world. Instead, they accept that suffering is inevitable, and choose to endure it with dignity. Iceborn spirituality is deeply rooted in the study and use of Serenite, their sacred runic language. Each rune is both a word and a prayer, a fragment of a long and frozen hymn written into the bones of the world. Iceborn believe that discipline, quiet sacrifice, and humility are the keys to true strength. Their communities are structured around guidance rather than rule, with elder runepriests and elemental scholars holding respected positions. Outsiders often mistake their silence for coldness, but to the Iceborn, words are only used when necessary, and magic speaks louder.
