Description: Zephar are squat, powerful humanoids, bodies packed dense like kiln fired clay. Skin comes in earthen tones, clay, charcoal, red brick, with a coarse, grit worn texture that shrugs off scrapes. They stand just below the human average, yet wide frames, blocky shoulders, and broad hands make them read larger, the way a loaded cart takes more space than its wheels suggest. Faces are plain and square, eyes set under heavy brows, noses blunt, beards thick where they grow, often clipped short to keep out of gears and grit. Movements are stiff and purposeful, elbows tucked, feet planted heel to toe, a practical economy that feels more like machinery in motion than dance. Everything about them hints at endurance, palms leathered where handles sit, nails squared like tools, breath slow and steady even under weight.

Culture: For a Zephar, life is work, not as punishment, as proof. They measure worth in repetitions endured, in spans of wall raised, in tons moved before the bell. Settlements lie low and wide, dormitory halls with row bunks and shared benches, a bathhouse that runs on a strict schedule, a bell that marks shifts, a foreman by consent rather than decree. Craft for its own beauty does not move them, they will polish a surface only so it will not catch, they will etch a line only so a measurement can be read at a glance. Speech is clipped, sentences welded from few words, and metaphor feels like sand in a bearing, they would rather show a jig than explain a poem. Outsiders often mistake this for coldness, yet Zephar bind tightly to those who show up, day after day, through rain and grit, friendships earned by shared loads rather than shared stories. They distrust grand plans and flashy magic, prefer fixtures to firelight, prefer a tested lever to a promise, and though they rarely boast, they quietly outlast most rivals.
