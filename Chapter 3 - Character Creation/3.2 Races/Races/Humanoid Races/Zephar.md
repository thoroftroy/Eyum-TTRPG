- Description: Zephar are squat, powerful humanoids with thick, compact builds and coarse skin in earthen tones, clay, charcoal, or red brick. They stand just below the average human, but their wide frames and broad hands make them seem much larger in presence. Their facial features are plain and square, often hidden behind heavy brows or thick beards. Their movements are stiff and purposeful, like machines in motion rather than dancers. While not unintelligent, they lack subtlety in expression or tone, often appearing blank or uninterested even when fully engaged.
    
- Culture: To a Zephar, life is labor. They are not driven by greed, invention, or glory, but by the rhythm of repetition. They find satisfaction in routines others would find soul-crushing: hauling stone, grinding grain, clearing rubble, or tending forges from sunup to sundown. Unlike Dwarves, who revel in craftsmanship and legacy, Zephar care little for beauty or wealth. They measure worth by endurance, who lasted longest, worked hardest, or kept going when others collapsed. Their settlements are built low and wide, with communal halls for rest and silent meals. Though gruff, Zephar can form powerful bonds with those who prove themselves through toil. Friendship is earned through sweat, not words. Most speak in blunt, clipped phrases and are suspicious of magic or metaphor. Outsiders often underestimate their quiet persistence, until they’re outpaced by it.
