- Description:Spritelings are tiny humanoid creatures, standing barely knee-high to most adults, with wiry limbs and oversized hands and feet that seem too big for their bodies. Their skin comes in muddy greens, dusty browns, or sickly yellows, and their faces are often round and expressive, with wild hair sprouting in all directions. Despite their comical proportions, Spritelings are alarmingly fast and have a low, twitchy energy that makes them seem constantly on edge. Their high-pitched voices, unpredictable behavior, and darting movements give them the reputation of being pests, but there's a sharp cunning behind their twitchy stares.
    
- Culture: Spritelings are not drawn to each other by any traditional concept of kinship or tribe. They prefer to glom onto larger, stronger races, gravitating toward whoever can offer protection, power, or entertainment. Their social instincts are based entirely on dominance and charisma, not bloodline or loyalty. If a Spriteling thinks you’re stronger, funnier, or louder than it is, it will probably start following you, mimicking your habits, and declaring itself your “second-in-command” unprompted. In many settlements, Spritelings are seen as nuisances, but others exploit their desperate loyalty by employing them as runners, spies, or for manual labor. They’re remarkably fertile, and have a habit of cropping up in strange places, from high towers to back-alley kitchens. While individually fragile and dim-witted, in numbers, Spritelings can become a force of chaotic mischief or dangerously clever opportunism.
