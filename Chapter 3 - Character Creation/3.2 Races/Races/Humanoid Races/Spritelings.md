Description: Spritelings are knee high, wiry limbed humanoids with outsized hands and feet that look borrowed from a creature twice their size. Skin runs to muddy greens, dusty browns, or sallow yellows, faces are round and hyper expressive, and hair sprouts in wild shocks that ignore combs. They move with a jittery, corner of the eye speed, voices piped and quick, and even at rest their muscles seem held like a coiled spring. The world often reads them as pests, but their twitchy stares hide sharp, situational cunning.

Culture: Spritelings do not gather by bloodline or tribe, they attach themselves to bigger, louder centers of gravity. They glom onto strong personalities for protection, power, or amusement, mimicking habits and crowning themselves second in command the moment it feels safe. In many towns they are nuisances, in others they are employed as runners, spies, or tireless hands. Fertile and opportunistic, they appear anywhere a niche opens, from tower rafters to kitchen alleys. Individually fragile and often underestimated, in numbers they can turn mischief into leverage and chaos into a plan.

Other:
- Skitter Dodge: When you are within 10 ft of a creature larger than you, you may Dash or Hide as a free action.
- Underfoot Escape: When a Medium or larger creature misses you with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to move up to 5 ft to an unoccupied space. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
- Furry of the Small: Each time you succeed in making an attack on a creature you get +1 to all damage done in subsequent attacks to that same creature. This effect can stack up to 10 + TotalLevel times.
