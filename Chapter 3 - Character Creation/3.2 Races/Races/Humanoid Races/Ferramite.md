Description: Ferramites look like living suits of armor, bodies cast in interlocking plates that flex along hidden seams. Their skin gleams with a metallic sheen, from dull iron and weathered bronze to mirror bright chrome, and beneath those plates run filaments of luminous energy that pulse around the face, joints, and breastplate. Limbs are long and lever strong, hands end in jointed, claw like fingers that click softly when they open and close. There is no hair, only the clean lines of forged metal and the glow of gemstone eyes, multifaceted and shifting color with mood or elemental exposure. Even at rest they hold themselves like statues, balanced and ready, and when they move it is with deliberate power, steps that feel like hammer strikes setting a rhythm through the ground. Clothing is spare and functional, belts and bindings over plate, ritual sashes for duels, engraved badges that record trials endured. A Ferramite’s voice carries a resonant timbre, quiet until a challenge is answered, then firm enough to still a room.

Culture: To a Ferramite, combat is not cruelty, it is a language that tells the truth of who you are. They grow up in training halls and open arenas, places where movement is studied like scripture and contests are witnessed like vows. Every bout is consented to, every duel has a herald and a judge, and cheating is a shame that can end a name. Children learn to fight before they learn to write, drills interlaced with lessons on restraint, mercy, and control. Strength is not a license to dominate, it is an obligation to protect, and the greatest respect is shown to those who can pull a strike one finger’s breadth from a rival’s throat. Outside their homeland they are mistaken for brutes, but Ferramites take pains to ensure force is a shield, not a cudgel. They prefer clear rules, recorded trials, and rites that leave both sides stronger. Status is earned through ordeals of endurance, precision, and will, and a life story is measured in witnesses, the elders who say they saw you stand, yield, learn, and return ready to be better.
