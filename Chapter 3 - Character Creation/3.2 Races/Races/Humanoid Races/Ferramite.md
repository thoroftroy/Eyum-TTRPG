- Description: Ferramites are humanoids whose bodies resemble forged armor rather than flesh. Their skin gleams with a metallic sheen, ranging from dull iron to gleaming chrome, and is divided into interlocking plates, like the natural armor of an insect or golem. Their limbs are elongated and powerful, and their hands end in jointed, claw-like fingers. Intricate veins of glowing energy pulse visibly through their bodies, especially around the face, joints, and chest. They have no hair, and their gemstone-like eyes are multifaceted and luminous, shifting color with emotional state or elemental exposure.
    
- Culture: The Ferramite way of life is built around conflict, not for conquest or hatred, but for growth. Combat is viewed as a sacred dance, a discipline through which one proves, tempers, and defines the self. Among Ferramites, to fight is to speak a truth deeper than words. Sparring matches, duels, and athletic contests are central to their identity, and every Ferramite child learns to fight before they learn to write. Despite their aggression, Ferramites are guided by an unshakable honor code: combat must be consensual, fair, and witnessed. Cheating is considered one of the greatest shames. Outside their homeland, Ferramites are often misjudged as brutal or warlike, but they take great pains to ensure their strength serves as protection, not oppression. They are slow to anger, but once challenged, they rarely back down. Respect among Ferramites is earned in trials, whether through strength, endurance, or sheer will.
