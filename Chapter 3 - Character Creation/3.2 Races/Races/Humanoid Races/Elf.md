Description: Elves are slender, poised humanoids with pointed ears, smooth skin, and a timeless grace that borders on supernatural. Their features are precise and symmetrical, a sculpted beauty that reads as intentional rather than accidental. Eyes shine in greens, silvers, and golds, hair grows in deep black, silver white, and forest greens that seem to hold their own light. They move with quiet certainty, not as creatures walking on the world but as beings nested within it, steps placed as if they already knew where the ground would welcome them. Conversation comes measured and exact, each word chosen like a rune being set, every pause long enough to weigh meaning. To shorter lived peoples they can feel mesmerizing and alien, a touch too perfect, a touch too deliberate, as though time has sanded away every wasted motion.

Culture: Elves are ancient and widespread, their ways braided with place. Beneath the Crystal Veil they build radiant cities under crystal towers humming with forgotten magics, in the Iron Spire they weave tree palaces out of living root and spell, and along the long roads they wander as story keepers, moving from glade to ruin to high ridge collecting moments rather than coin. Across these branches runs a common thread, a detached view of time and relationship. Family names do not anchor them, lineage is oral if remembered at all, and identity is earned through deed, role, or title taken on for a century and then set down. They are not unfeeling, they simply live at a different tempo, and the urgency of shorter lives can seem noisy against their long chords. Beauty is a duty, in language, in battle, in spellcraft, and a life is meant to be made like art, deliberate, revised, perfected over years that would make another people founders and elders several times over.
