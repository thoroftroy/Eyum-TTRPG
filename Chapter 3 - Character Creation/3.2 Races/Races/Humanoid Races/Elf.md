- Description: Elves are slender, poised humanoids with pointed ears, smooth skin, and a timeless grace that borders on supernatural. Their features are symmetrical and refined, lending them an almost sculpted beauty. Their eyes come in shades of green, silver, or gold, and their hair grows in vibrant tones, from deep black to silver-white to forest green. Elves move with the silent confidence of a creature that belongs to the world rather than walking upon it. Though they resemble humans, every motion, word, and breath seems just a touch too perfect, too deliberate, both mesmerizing and alien.Â 
    
- Culture: Elves are ancient, widespread, and culturally diverse. Some dwell deep beneath the Crystal Veil, where civilization glows under crystal towers powered by forgotten magics. Others live in the canopy cities of the Iron Spire, in tree-palaces woven by spell and root. Still others wander the world in nomadic tribes, drifting from glade to ruin to mountaintop, collecting stories rather than gold. Despite these differences, most elves share a detached view of time and relationships. They rarely form nuclear families and do not use surnames; lineage is oral, if remembered at all. Instead, they find identity in deeds, roles, or titles earned. While not cold or unfeeling, Elves often struggle to relate to the urgency and chaos of shorter-lived species. They seek beauty in everything, language, battle, spellcraft, and believe that a life well-lived is one crafted like art.
