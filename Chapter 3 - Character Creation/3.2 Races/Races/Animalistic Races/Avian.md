- Description: Avians are tall, lean birdfolk with humanoid bodies covered in sleek white feathers. Their facial features blend avian sharpness with humanoid symmetry, possessing curved beaks, narrow eyes, and crests that rise when agitated or inspired. Their arms end in strong, clawed hands, while large, powerful wings protrude from their back, allowing for bursts of flight at extraordinary speed. Though humanoid in structure, their entire frame is optimized for aerial movement: light bones, muscular legs, and a sweeping wingspan often greater than their height. Their voices carry a melodious, hollow quality, with speech often laced with tonal shifts like birdsong.
    
- Culture: Avian society is deeply spiritual and guided by principles of freedom, neutrality, and celestial order. They believe themselves to be born from the sky’s breath and view the world below as sacred, but dangerous. Avians tend to live in cliffside nests, floating towers, or wind-blown peaks, far from conflict and grounded politics. Peaceful by nature, they avoid interference with other races unless compelled by moral obligation. When an Avian witnesses injustice or cruelty, their deep sense of cosmic balance pushes them to act, often swooping in with deadly precision, then disappearing before their presence can shift the world’s course. Their laws are simple but absolute: never betray kin, never cage another, never kill without cause. Avians admire clarity, swiftness, and justice, and their elders are revered not for power but for consistency of purpose. Those who lose their wings (due to injury or exile) are seen as cursed or fallen, often choosing a life of silence and solitude.
