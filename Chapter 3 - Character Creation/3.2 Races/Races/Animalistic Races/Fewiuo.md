Description: Fewiuo are winged humanoids with avian traits, their upper bodies mostly human-like but with reverse-jointed, scaled legs ending in sharp talons. Their broad, feathered wings vary greatly in size, color, and shape depending on lineage. Their builds tend toward lean muscle, optimized for agility in the air, though some subraces are heavier and more powerful. Their eyes are keen and often brightly colored, and many wear light, aerodynamic clothing to maximize their mobility. To outsiders, Fewiuo can appear strikingly majestic, especially white-feathered individuals, but their demeanor and intelligence vary widely between subraces.

Culture: Freedom is the heartbeat of Fewiuo culture. They live in open landscapes and high places, avoiding strict laws or confining structures. Most Fewiuo travel in loose flocks, united more by shared habits and affection than political obligation. Music, dance, and storytelling are valued as expressions of personal freedom, and disputes are often settled through aerial contests of skill rather than violence. Still, the Fewiuo are far from uniform, each subrace develops its own customs, ranging from the noble loyalty of the Clauio to the vanity of the Angeliuo. While they often appear carefree, Fewiuo can be fiercely protective of those they consider part of their “flock,” be they kin, comrades, or chosen friends.
