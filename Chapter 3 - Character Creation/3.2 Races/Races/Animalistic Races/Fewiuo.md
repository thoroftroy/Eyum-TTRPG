Description: Fewiuo are winged humanoids whose frames balance grace and strength. Their upper bodies are largely human in proportion, but their legs are reverse jointed and scaled, ending in razor talons that bite into stone and bark with equal confidence. Wings define them, great fans of feathers that differ wildly in span and pattern between lineages. Some Fewiuo carry long, sail-like primaries for distance riding, others bear compact, muscular wings for brutal stops and explosive turns. Their bones are light, their torsos lean, and their shoulders are corded for lift and control. Eyes cut bright against their plumage and catch detail at impossible distances. Garb favors motion, layered wraps that do not catch the wind, with harness points for tools, instruments, or trophies won in flight. To groundfolk, Fewiuo often read as statuesque or startling, especially white-feathered stock, but every subrace carries its own posture and pride.

Culture: Freedom is the Fewiuo heartbeat. They build lives in open air and high country, cliff nests and cloudlines, ruins turned into roosts, and schooners refit as sky-lodges. Flocks form by choice rather than decree, bands of kin and comrades held together by affection, practice, and promise, not law. Their art is motion, music and dance braided through storytelling, and disputes settle in contests of skill, loops and dives meant to test nerve more than draw blood. Though easy with laughter, they guard their flocks fiercely, and a slight against one is answered by many. Customs diverge by lineage, from the oath-steady Clauio to the mirror-bright vanity of Angeliuo, but all Fewiuo honor the right to rise, to leave, to return changed. When storms come, they mark the wind with ribbons and whistle-codes, log the currents, and pass maps forward, building a sky-memory as old as their bones.
