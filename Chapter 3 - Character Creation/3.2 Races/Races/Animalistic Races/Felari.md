Description: Felari are lithe, feline humanoids with digitigrade legs, long tails used for balance, and soft fur that ranges from solid colors to stripes, spots, or subtle gradients. Their faces are distinctly catlike without being bestial: forward-facing eyes, short muzzles, and expressive ears that constantly twitch with mood and attention. Their hands are dexterous, with retractable claws that remain hidden unless needed. Felari move quietly and confidently, rarely wasting motion, and tend to favor light clothing and armor that does not restrict flexibility or tail movement.

Culture: Felari culture prizes independence, curiosity, and personal freedom. Communities are loosely structured, often forming around shared territory rather than strict hierarchy. Authority is earned through competence, not position, and individuals are expected to look after themselves before relying on others. Felari are natural wanderers, driven by curiosity and a desire to experience new places, sounds, and challenges. While they may appear aloof or self-interested to outsiders, Felari form strong personal bonds and are fiercely loyal to those they choose to trust. Many become scouts, rogues, travelers, or mercenaries, drawn to roles that reward awareness and adaptability.
