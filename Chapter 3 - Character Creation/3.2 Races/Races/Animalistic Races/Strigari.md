- Description: Strigari are nocturnal avian-folk with sleek feathers, silent wings, and luminous eyes that pierce the dark. Their faces are flat and disk-shaped like owls, but they have humanoid hands with talon-tipped fingers. They often wear cloaks or layered sashes made of preserved feathers or leathers from their fallen kin. Their voices are low, breathy, and wise-sounding even when young.
    
- Culture: Strigari dwell in high, hidden aeries and act as watchers, archivists, and judges. They are bound by complex codes of memory and story, believing each generation must remember the lessons of the last. Strigari speak rarely and with care, every word is part of their ancestral ledger. They are fiercely loyal to their kin-flocks and will cross continents to uphold an oath. Silence is not weakness to them, it is the weight of truth.
