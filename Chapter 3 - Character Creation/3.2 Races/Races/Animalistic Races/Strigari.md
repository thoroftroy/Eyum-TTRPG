Description: Strigari are nocturnal avian folk built for silence and precision. Feathers lie in tight, matte layers that drink sound, wings articulate with owlish elasticity, and the face forms a flat disc that funnels the faintest whisper to luminous eyes. Hands are true hands with talon tips, capable of scribing and surgery, yet cruel when needed. Most carry cloaks, cords, and ledgers stitched from preserved feathers and leathers, a portable archive of names, debts, and rulings. In darkness they move like a closing thought, weight balanced over the toes, shoulders tucked to break wind, breath held until the moment to speak. Voices come low and breathy, a hush that makes listeners lean forward. 

Culture: Strigari keep high, hidden aeries where memory is law. They watch, they record, they judge, every oath etched into family ledgers, every debt indexed by night, and every verdict spoken once, then carried forward as precedent. They speak rarely and with care, since a careless word stains the ledger, and a broken promise stains the name. Kin flocks are bound by oaths that outlive individuals, a Strigari will cross continents to fulfill a promise that an ancestor signed. In dealings with other avian peoples they are proud to the point of offense, convinced that their discipline and silence prove superiority. They will aid a flock that shows proper respect, they will correct a flock that does not, and they will never apologize for the correction. Silence, to them, is not weakness, it is the weight of truth, and speech is a tool used only when precision matters.
