- Description: Thryz are chitin-armored insectoids with four arms, compound eyes, and bladed forelimbs reminiscent of mantis claws. Their carapaces shimmer in metallic hues, bronze, emerald, and sapphire tones are common. Their bodies are segmented, jointed in strange ways, and capable of great bursts of movement.
    
- Culture: Thryz dwell in hive-fortresses beneath wastelands or mountains, governed by caste systems where strength, speed, and intellect determine one's role. Though alien to most other species, Thryz are not emotionless, they form deep bonds with their clutchmates and view society as an extension of self. They do not lie, as their minds work on a strict logic of purpose and consequence. Diplomacy is rare but highly respected when granted. Other races often fear them due to their appearance and efficient combat styles.
