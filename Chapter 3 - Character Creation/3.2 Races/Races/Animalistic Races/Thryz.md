Description: Thryz are chitin-armored insectoids built for speed, leverage, and ruthless efficiency. Their bodies are segmented and jointed in unfamiliar ways, hips that swivel farther than mammalian norms, knees that coil like springs, shoulders that ratchet forward for sudden reach. Four arms define their silhouette, two are dexterous, tool-ready manipulators, two are bladed forelimbs reminiscent of mantis scythes, ridged and angled to bite through hide and cordage. Carapaces shimmer in metallic hues, bronze, emerald, and sapphire tones are common, each plate set with fine sutures that flex without cracking. Compound eyes gather and compare motion across dozens of facets, a glittering array that reads wind, shadow, and the twitch of a bowstring. Mouthparts are masked by a hardened lip when speaking with other peoples, but pull back in combat to reveal shearing mandibles. When at rest they are statuesque, when the signal comes they explode into motion, a click of tarsal spurs, a blur of forelimbs, a clean finish.

Culture: Thryz societies are hive-fortresses carved under wastelands and mountains, architecture that flows like grown resin, galleries on galleries tied by helical ramps and kill-corridors. Caste is function, not birth, strength, speed, and intellect determine one’s role, and roles can change if a worker proves a thinker or a cutter becomes a tactician. From clutch-day, Thryz are taught that the hive is an extension of self, a thousand limbs, a single purpose, so they do not lie, because lies weaken the geometry of trust. This does not make them naïve, it makes them literal, bargains are etched, duties accounted, failures owned. Diplomacy is rare, but when offered it is ritual and binding, a formal recognition that another people has earned a place in the ledger. Bonds with clutchmates run deep, grief is recorded on the carapace in scored lines that other Thryz can read with their fingertips. Outsiders fear the look of them and the efficiency of their combat drills, but those who travel with a Thryz cohort learn the cadence of their care, water shared, watches held, tools returned to the hand that needs them next.

Other:
- Chitin Plating: You have resistance to non-magical slashing damage.
- Darkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.
- Quartet Limbs: You can wield and manipulate objects with four arms. You are able to make attacks with your normal hands and Mantis Scythes all in the same turn, treat each hand beyond the first attack as a separate weapon for a duel wielding attack.
- Mantis Scythes: Your bladed forelimbs are natural finesse weapons that deal 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. If you move at least 10 ft straight toward a target before hitting with a scythe attack, add +1d4 base melee damage to that attack.
- Compound Eyes: You have advantage on Spot checks to notice motion or sudden changes within 60 ft, and dim light does not impose penalties on your Spot checks.
