Description: Stingerfolk are towering, armored humanoids whose bodies carry the marks of desert predators and siege engines alike. Heavy chitin plates band chest, shoulders, hips, and thighs, with flexible joints webbed by softer segments that still shrug off blade edges. Hands end in thick, split claws fit for crushing grips and hook pulls, while a massive scorpion tail rises from the lower back, jointed in long arcs, the final segment housing a recurved sting that drips with clear, bitter venom. Faces are rigid and angular, mandible like jaws tightening when they focus, and their segmented eyes take on glassy reds or harsh yellows that drink detail from glare and shadow. They move low and coiled, weight close to the ground until the moment breaks, then the whole frame unspools in a decisive strike. Carapace tones run matte black, umber, and sandy bronze, often dusted to match the dunes and scrub where they range. Armor and clothing are spare and functional, webbed belts for water stones, bone or metal sign rings placed along the tail, and clan marks etched where plates will not chip.

Culture: Stingerfolk build their society on pride tempered by discipline, loyalty proven by labor, and honor measured in formation rather than boasting. Households gather into hives and warbands, each member drilled to know a role and to hold it without complaint, scout, shield line, vanguard, quartermaster, sting medic. Commands are crisp and repeated until they become rhythm, call and answer patterns are tapped on tail rings and armor plates so orders carry through dust, wind, and chaos. Oaths are public and lifelong, sealed with a cut of the sting tip and witnessed by the unit, and an oath breaker is cut from the roll without drama and without appeal. Betrayal is rare because memory is long and ledgers are kept clear, favors owed and harms done are recorded in plain script, paid down steadily, never forgotten. Instruction begins early, younglings learn balance, restraint, and tail control before they are trusted with a weapon, and every adult trains both a martial craft and a practical trade so the hive can march and mend without asking favors. Hospitality is formal but real, allies who carry their share and keep their word are fed, armed, and guarded until the bond is met, then sent on with marks of safe passage. Outsiders often mistake silence for hostility and size for cruelty, yet among their own the Stingerfolk are poets of violence, tacticians of precision, and careful keepers of order, reciting battle epics at dusk, drilling silent maneuvers at dawn, and measuring leadership by calm hands and clean decisions rather than loud speeches.
