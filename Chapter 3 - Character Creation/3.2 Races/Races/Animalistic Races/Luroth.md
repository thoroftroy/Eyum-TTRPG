Description:  Luroth are amphibious humanoids with broad frames, long powerful legs, and thick, smooth skin that retains moisture even in dry climates. Their faces are blunt and wide, with heavy jaws, flat noses, and large, lidless eyes adapted for dim water and fog-heavy environments. Their skin ranges from dull greens and browns to slate gray or deep blue, often mottled or banded like river stone or algae. Subtle webbing connects their fingers and toes, not enough to appear monstrous, but enough to hint at their origin. Luroth move with a slow, grounded confidence on land, but become surprisingly quick and graceful once submerged.

Culture: Luroth societies form around rivers, marshlands, floodplains, and coastal shallows, places where land and water constantly shift. Their culture values endurance, restraint, and memory. Decisions are rarely rushed, and traditions are passed through long oral histories rather than written record. Strength is respected, but only when paired with patience and self-control. Luroth tend to distrust impulsive behavior and short-term thinking, but they are not hostile to outsiders, merely cautious. Once trust is earned, it is rarely broken. Many Luroth leave their homelands as traders, guards, or guides, carrying their steady outlook into faster, louder societies.
