- Description: Veltraxi are avian humanoids with sleek feathers, clawed feet, and beaks that vary from thin and pointed to curved and predatory. Unlike true birds, they have arms in place of wings, though vestigial feathers still grow from their shoulders and spine. Their voices are haunting and mimicry-based, and they often speak in fragments of conversations they’ve overheard. Veltraxi eyes are large and black, and their clothing tends to be minimal, lightweight, and often stolen or cobbled together.
    
- Culture: Veltraxi hail from wind-blasted cliffs and crumbling cities long abandoned by others. They are scavengers by necessity, collectors of voices, secrets, and lost things. While not malicious, they operate on a system of need and cleverness, what you cannot protect, you do not deserve. Many Veltraxi grow into expert spies, scouts, and infiltrators, and their uncanny mimicry makes them natural imposters. They value knowledge above law and survival above pride. Most groups follow loose flocks, with no leaders, only voices that sound the most convincing.
