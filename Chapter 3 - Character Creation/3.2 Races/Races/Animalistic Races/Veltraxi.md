Description: Veltraxi are lean avian humanoids with beaks that range from fine and needled to heavy and hooked. Their feet end in grasping talons, their forearms are true arms rather than wings, and along the shoulders and spine grow vestigial fans of feathers that shiver when the wind shifts. Black, oil-blue, and charcoal are common base colors, shot through with iridescent sheens like wet slate. They carry themselves low and forward, heads cocked, eyes wide and glassy, watching and listening even while they speak. Their voices are haunted by mimicry, sentences stitched from scraps of overheard conversation, street cries, lullabies, and prayer-ends, delivered with unnerving accuracy. Clothing is practical and light, belts and wraps that do not flap, pockets stitched on the inside for quiet hands, trophies and trinkets braided into cords at the neck or ankle. They are quick to stillness, quicker to motion, and seldom waste a gesture.

Culture: Veltraxi live where wind and ruin meet, cliff warrens above the surf, dead districts of abandoned cities, bell towers and skeletal bridges. They scavenge out of habit and philosophy, what is unguarded belongs to the wind, what is guarded invites a better plan. Flocks are loose and leaderless, authority is the voice that convinces in the moment, and memory is kept in echoes, a chorus of repeated phrases that turns news into map and warning. They value knowledge over law and survival over pride, so a clever trick that keeps the flock fed is a virtue. Many become spies, scouts, and infiltrators, trading secrets for shelter. Their reputation as thieves is not entirely wrong, but among themselves the line between theft and salvage is a matter of wit and timing. They train their young to watch without blinking, to listen without interrupting, and to talk only when the words can change the outcome.
