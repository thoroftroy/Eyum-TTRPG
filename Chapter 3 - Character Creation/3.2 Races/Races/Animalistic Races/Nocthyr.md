Description: Nocthyr are bat-like humanoids with lean builds, long arms, and wide membrane wings stretching from wrist to hip. When folded, their wings drape like heavy cloaks; when spread, they reveal thin, veined skin that darkens toward the edges. Their faces are narrow and angular, with large ears, sharp teeth, and small forward-facing eyes adapted to low light rather than daylight clarity. Skin and wing membranes range from deep browns and charcoal blacks to muted purples and ash-gray. Nocthyr movements are light and deliberate, favoring silence and balance over raw speed, and many adopt layered clothing that allows their wings to move freely.

Culture: Nocthyr communities favor high places: cliff faces, cavern ceilings, ruined towers, and dense forest canopies. Their culture emphasizes awareness, restraint, and cooperation. Loud displays of emotion or power are considered wasteful, and conflicts are usually settled through negotiation or withdrawal rather than confrontation. Nocthyr place great importance on listening, both literally and socially, and elders are valued for perception rather than authority. Outsiders often find them distant or unsettling, but Nocthyr are observant and deeply attentive once trust is established. Many leave their enclaves as scouts, messengers, or night-watchers, roles that suit their instincts.

Other:
* Echolocation: You are blind past 20 ft unless you use echolocation (bonus action) in a specific direction, after 6 seconds (on your next turn) you will know what is in that direction (5 ft wide 100 ft line). 
* Glide: While falling and not incapacitated, you may glide instead of falling normally. You descend 5 ft for every 15 ft of horizontal movement and do not take fall damage if you glide for at least 10 ft before landing.
* Night Adapted: You have advantage on checks made to notice creatures or movement in dim light or darkness.
