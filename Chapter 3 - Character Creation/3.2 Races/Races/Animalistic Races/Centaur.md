Description: Centaurs are powerful, half equine, half humanoid nomads. From the waist down they bear the muscular frame of a warhorse, heavy with working muscle, thick fetlocks, and sure footed hooves. Above, a broad shouldered humanoid torso carries bow, spear, and burden with practiced ease. Coats range from bay and dapple gray to rare piebalds and midnight black, while skin and hair follow the human spectrum, often braided and bound with beads, bone totems, and weather worn cords. Eyes stay keen and steady, nostrils flare to read wind, and breath fogs in cold air like a draft animal at work. Tack jingles when they move, hooves drum a cadence that becomes thunder at a charge, and even at rest their weight seems rooted to the ground. They favor durable leather, woven saddle blankets, and bandoliers that keep tools ready at a run.

Culture: Herds roam grass seas, scrublands, and the open margins of forest, tracing seasonal graze and star paths kept by chant and hoof prints. Law is oral and immediate, elders arbitrate, champions defend, scouts decide the route, and all share the load. Oaths matter, trade promises, escort contracts, and grazing treaties are witnessed by the whole herd and repeated until even foals can speak them. Camps are circular and efficient, ringed with standing poles and wind bells that sing the weather’s temper. Walls are distrusted, heavy roofs dull the senses, so Centaurs prize open horizons, practical craft, and endurance over ornament. An oath breaker is cast out to walk alone until honor is reclaimed by service or sacrifice. Foals learn bowcraft at a run, and even elders drill dawn charges to keep the herd’s rhythm. Guests who respect the ring and pull their weight eat well and travel safely, those who cheat the circle find the trail behind them empty and the plains ahead unfriendly.

Other:
- Sure Footed: You have advantage on checks and saving throws to resist being knocked prone or shoved by effects that push or trip you.
- Trampling Charge: If you move at least 20 ft straight toward a creature and hit it with a Hooves attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a Strength save, DC 12 + Proficiency Bonus + STR mod, or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, you may make one extra Hooves attack against it as a bonus action.
- Hooves: Your hooves are natural weapons that deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. You are proficient with your hooves.
- Quadruped Frame: Tight passages less than 10 ft wide count as squeezing for you. Ladders and narrow vertical shafts require a secure ramp or specialized tackle at GM discretion.
- Pack Runner: When you take the Dash action in natural terrain, ignore the first 10 ft of nonmagical difficult terrain you enter during that movement.
