Description: Grusk are thick-built, boar-like humanoids with heavy shoulders, strong necks, and dense muscle packed under coarse hair. Their faces are broad with flat snouts, visible tusks, and small eyes that miss little when they’re focused. Skin tones run from pink and ruddy brown to deep gray, often marked by scars, calluses, and sun-worn patches from hard labor and hard living. Their hair is usually dark and bristled, growing thicker along the arms, spine, and jawline. Grusk tend to carry themselves like a wall that decided to stand up, slow to shift, hard to knock down, and louder than they think they are.

Culture: Grusk communities value straightforwardness, endurance, and work that produces something real. They respect strength, but they respect reliability more. A Grusk who keeps their word and shows up when it matters is worth more than a loud braggart, no matter how dangerous the braggart looks. Many Grusk live in tight-knit clans or traveling warbands, with strong traditions around feasts, oaths, and shared burden. They argue loudly, laugh harder, and settle problems face-to-face. Outsiders often assume they’re crude or simple; most Grusk don’t bother correcting that unless it becomes a problem. When a Grusk decides someone is “their people,” they become stubbornly protective.

Other:
- Tusks: You can make an unarmed strike with your tusks. If you hit, it deals 1d8 piercing damage instead of the normal unarmed damage.
- Grusk Stubbornness: You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
- Hard to Drop: Once per long rest, when you would be reduced to 0 HP, you may instead be reduced to 1 HP.
- Pig-like Stomach: You are immune to being poisoned from food or drink and can eat rotten food with no downsides.
