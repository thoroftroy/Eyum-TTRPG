Description: Naga are serpentine humanoids with a human torso extending from the long, muscular body of a snake. Scale patterns and colors mark lineage, deep reds and greens to stark white or pitch black. Faces are sharp, eyes narrow, and some lineages bear true fangs while others are fangless. Their tails drive impressive speed, coil for leverage or intimidation, and let many rear upright to strike with an imposing silhouette.

Culture: Naga prize strength, skill, and cunning. Standing in society is earned by proven ability rather than birthright. Competition is constant and pragmatic, power maintains order and unchecked weakness invites collapse. Alliances form and dissolve on mutual benefit, and betrayal is treated as a tool, not a moral failure, so oaths are written narrowly and enforced strictly.

Other:
- Serpentine Resilience: Resistance to poison damage and heat damage.
- Amphibious: You can breathe underwater continuously for up to 1 hour.
- Darkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.
