- Description: Chelonar are humanoids with broad, domed shells on their backs and limbs thick with scaled skin. Their heads are smooth and beaked, their eyes steady and unblinking. The shell is part of their spine and ribs, and it can be colorful or mottled depending on region. They move slowly and deliberately, and their fingers are strong, stubby, and perfect for grinding tools or digging channels in stone.
    
- Culture: Chelonar are an ancient people who see time as the greatest teacher. They do not rush, plan far ahead, and are unmoved by mortal urgency. Their societies are built around communal wisdom, with elder councils that may deliberate for years before making a change. Chelonar value duty, memory, and groundedness, both literally and spiritually. They are often builders, archivists, or protectors of natural relics. While pacifists by philosophy, they are unrelenting defenders once a boundary is crossed.
