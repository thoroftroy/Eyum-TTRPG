Description: Chelonar are humanoids with broad, domed shells fused to the spine and ribs, their limbs thick with scaled skin and their heads smooth and beaked. Eyes remain steady and unblinking, and shell patterns range from bright, lacquered swirls to mottled stone tones depending on region. They move with deliberation rather than haste; steps are planted, weight tested, and silence valued over speed. Hands are strong and square-fingered, ideal for grinding tools, carving channels in stone, or bracing a shield-line for hours. Their homes are laid into cliffsides and river-cut canyons, engineered to last centuries: water-diverters, root-stays, and stone ribs that flex without breaking. Clothing trends toward layered work-wraps, tool loops, and resin-sealed shawls that shed grit and spray. Voices are low and measured; elders cultivate a cadence like slowly stacked stones, where meaning sits heavy at the end of a sentence.

Culture: Time is the master teacher. Chelonar councils sit for seasons before shifting a law by a fingerâ€™s breadth; change is only good if it endures. Communal memory is sacred: long-span ledgers etched into shell-tiles record floods, harvests, and promises. Youth serve rotations as runners, carpers, and archivists before declaring a life craft. Pacifists by philosophy, they mark their borders with cairns and prayer-rings; cross them with violence, and defenders rise like a moving wall, silent, implacable, and unwilling to yield even a handspan. Duty, memory, and groundedness form their triad of virtue. Outsiders sometimes mistake their calm for slowness; in truth, Chelonar prefer precision to hurry. They honor those who build: keepers of water, menders of roads, and guardians who survive the waiting years between storms. When a shell is cracked in service, the community inlays it with metal seams and river-stone, turning scars into scripture.

Other:
- Shell-Tuck: As a bonus action, retreat into your shell. You gain +4 AC and your movement becomes 0. While tucked, you cannot take actions, bonus actions, or reactions. You must exit at the start of your turn, which ends your turn.
- Immovable Bastion: You cannot be moved or shoved unless the attacker is at least two size categories larger than you. You also have advantage on checks or saves to resist being knocked prone.
- Layered Carapace: You have resistance to non-magical slashing damage.
- Stone Sense: While you are in contact with solid ground, you have advantage on Perception checks to detect approaching creatures within 10 ft that are also in contact with that surface.
- Bulwark Stance: If you did not move this turn, you can use your reaction to give an adjacent ally +2 AC against one attack. A Small or Medium ally directly behind you counts as having half cover from attacks in a line through you until the start of your next turn.
