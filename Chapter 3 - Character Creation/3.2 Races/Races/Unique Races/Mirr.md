- Description: The Mirr have no true form. In their natural state, they appear as pale, hairless humanoids with featureless faces and liquid-like skin. However, most rarely show this shape. From birth, Mirr can alter their bodies, voice, skin, bone, and muscle, with uncanny ease. Their transformations are smooth, never half-formed, and often perfected with unnatural precision. Their eyes, even when shifted, never reflect light naturally, betraying their origin.
    
- Culture: Mirr society is paradoxical, built on concealment, yet grounded in shared truth. Clans of Mirr exist in secret enclaves where members share their “True Name” with only trusted kin. Outside these sanctuaries, Mirr live as actors, diplomats, infiltrators, or drifters. Their ability makes them feared and mistrusted, yet indispensable in political or covert roles. Mirr value adaptability, observation, and subtlety above brute strength or glory. They see identity as a tool, not a truth, an idea unsettling to more fixed races.
    
- Other: May take the appearance of any humanoid of the same size category as an action. This transformation lasts until ended or changed again. (Does not grant traits of copied races (only appearance, voice, gender, and body type))
