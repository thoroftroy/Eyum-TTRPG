Description: Mirr have no fixed faces. In their natural state they are pale, hairless humanoids with featureless visages and skin that moves like liquid under a thin film. Most never show this shape in public. From youth they learn to sculpt bone lines, skin tone, gait, and voice with uncanny smoothness, swapping bodies as easily as clothing. Even in perfect masks their eyes betray them to careful watchers, they never throw a true catchlight, reading matte or “wrong” under bright illumination. Their manner is poised and economical, and their transformations complete between one heartbeat and the next with no half formed seams.

Culture: Mirr clans keep hidden enclaves where members exchange True Names and histories under strict oath. Outside those spaces they live as actors, mediators, spies, artisans, or drifters, studying habits, dialects, and wardrobes until they can pass where others would stumble. Identity is a tool in Mirr thought, not a truth, and that philosophy unsettles many peoples who tie honor to a single face. Inside a clan the baseline ethic is consent and disclosure—who you are here, who you are out there, and what is shared with whom—because masks without rules break trust. Their arts prize observation, memory, and clean exits; a well executed departure is considered a craft equal to a rousing speech.

Other:
- Assume Shape: As an action, take the appearance of a Small or Medium humanoid you have observed for at least 1 minute. You may alter height by up to ±6 inches and weight by up to ±30 percent, keeping the same Size. The change is physical (not an illusion) but does not grant traits, stats, or abilities of the copied race or person. Gear does not transform. The form lasts until you change again, fall unconscious, or die.
- Prepared Faces: You can imprint up to three specific appearances you have fully studied. You may switch to an imprinted face as a bonus action. Replacing an imprint takes 10 minutes of focused study of the target and erases one stored face of your choice.
- Copy Voice: You can reproduce any voice and common sounds you have heard in the last 24 hours. You have advantage on checks to impersonate that speaker’s cadence and manner.
- Lightless Eyes: In bright light, a creature that spends a round observing you may attempt a Spot check, DC 15, to notice your eyes’ unnatural lack of reflection. A creature that physically examines you for a round may attempt a Search check, DC 14, to detect minute transition seams. Creatures personally familiar with the person you are impersonating have advantage on these checks.
- Mutable Physiology: You have resistance to Poison damage and advantage on saving throws against disease. You also have advantage on checks and saving throws to escape grapples, bindings, or manacles, and can squeeze through gaps as narrow as 6 inches without squeezing penalties.
- Disguise Craft: You are proficient with a Disguise Kit. When you have access to appropriate materials and 10 minutes of preparation, you gain +2 Base Acc on the first social check you make to pass as your prepared identity.
