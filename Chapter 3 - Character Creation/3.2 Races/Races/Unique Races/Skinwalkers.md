Description: Skinwalkers look convincingly human at a glance, but their features seem “averaged,” as if borrowed, symmetry a little too neat, smiles a little too practiced. Their bodies are light, flexible, and scar-free no matter how rough the work. In private, a Skinwalker’s flesh moves like warm wax, letting them re-form bone lines, hair, and skin tone in seconds. Clothing doesn’t change with them, so veterans favor layered, strap-fast gear that can pass for many cuts and cultures. The best way to describe a Skinwalker would be; Uncanny Valley. 

Culture: Most Skinwalkers scatter into other peoples’ cities, hiding in plain sight. Family units are small and mobile; safety comes from staying unremarkable, learning faces, and vanishing when attention rises. Their oral teaching is blunt: look, learn, replace. They keep caches of generic clothing, forged seals, and “safe-names” to rotate identities. Trust is earned by actions, not stories, anyone can wear a story. A few bands sell infiltration and witness-protection services; others run cons, heists, or counter-espionage for pay. 

Other:
- Borrowed Mask (Shapeshift): As a bonus action, assume the appearance of a Small or Medium humanoid you have observed for at least 1 minute. You can alter height by ±6 inches and weight by ±30%. The form is physical (not an illusion) but doesn’t change your stats. Your gear doesn’t transform. The change lasts until you shift again or are unconscious.
- Copy Voice: You can reproduce any voice and common sounds you’ve heard in the last 24 hours. You have triple advantage on checks to impersonate that speaker.
- Surface Checks: A creature that physically examines you for a round can attempt Investigation (DC 18) to detect seams in the disguise (DC 14 if you’ve taken damage since your last turn). Creatures which are familiar with whom you are impersonating have advantage on this check. 
- Mutable Physiology: Resistance to Poison damage and advantage on saving throws against disease.
- Tell-Tale Glint: Mirrors, scrying pools, and similar reflections show a faint blue glow in your eyes.
