- Description: Ents are living titans of bark and leaf, towering humanoids whose bodies resemble ancient trees in both structure and spirit. Their skin is rough and grooved, knotted with age and etched by the passage of seasons. Their eyes glow like polished amber, and their heads sprout thick crowns of living leaves, vines, or moss that change with the environment around them. Each Ent develops a unique "seasonal bloom," which may include flowers, fungal caps, berries, or even glowing sap, depending on where they were rooted. Their massive limbs are root-like in their stability, and their hands end in long fingers capable of coiling and merging into surfaces they touch.
    
- Culture: Ents are not merely residents of forests, they are extensions of the forest itself. They are born when old trees awaken with spirit, their bodies shaped by the elemental forces of their homeland. As such, each Ent bears the memory of the land that birthed them, and many possess deep, instinctive knowledge of their environment’s history. They live in meditative stillness for years at a time, often remaining motionless for entire seasons, communing with birds, insects, and the flow of sunlight through canopy. Conflict is rare among Ents, for they speak slowly and value harmony above pride. However, when their grove is endangered, Ents become furious avatars of wrath, tearing down roads, crushing intruders, and summoning storms with their rage. They raise their young communally and pass on wisdom through scent, gesture, and touch, rather than spoken word. Outsiders who earn their trust may find a loyal protector and sage whose patience eclipses lifetimes.
    
- Other: Ent do not die from old age, they simply grow larger and stronger, however as they age they also grow considerably slower, meaning that most don’t survive much past 600 - 800 years old.
