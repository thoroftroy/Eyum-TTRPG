Description: Ents are living titans of bark and leaf, towering humanoids whose bodies mirror ancient trees in both structure and spirit. Skin is rough and grooved, knotted by age and season, veined with living sap that can glow faintly at dusk. Eyes shine like polished amber, and crowns of leaves, moss, or vine rise from the brow and shoulders, shifting with climate and soil. Each Ent carries a unique seasonal bloom, flowers, berries, fungi, or resinous sap that reflects the land that first woke them. Limbs are root sure and heavy, fingers long enough to hook into stone, and when an Ent stands still the forest tries to claim them, leaf litter gathering at their feet until they move again.

Culture: Ents do not merely live in groves, they extend them. They awaken from old trees where spirit and place agree, and carry the long memory of that ground. The day to day is patient craft, pruning blight, guiding growth, and listening to birds, insects, and wind lines across the canopy. Speech is slow and careful; most disputes end with stillness and shared listening rather than force. Yet when a boundary is crossed, an Ent moves like weather, tearing roads, breaking engines, and turning intruders aside with method rather than fury. Wisdom is passed by scent, touch, and gesture more than words, and young are raised communally by those who can spare seasons to teach. Outsiders who earn trust find a protector who plans in years, not hours, and keeps promises as faithfully as roots keep soil.

Other:
- Barkhide: While not wearing manufactured armor, your natural armor sets your AC to 14 + CON mod. You can still use a shield.
- Rooted Colossus: As a bonus action, you may root until the start of your next turn. While rooted, your speed is 0, you cannot be pushed or knocked prone, you have advantage on checks and saves to resist forced movement, and your melee reach increases by 5 ft.    
- Slam: Your wooden fists are natural weapons that deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage. You are proficient with your slam.
- Forest Stride: Nonmagical vegetation does not count as difficult terrain for you. You have advantage on Search checks to locate tracks, fresh cutting, or recent alterations in natural terrain within 30 ft.
- Treeform Stillness: If you remain motionless for 1 minute outdoors among trees or heavy brush, you have advantage on Stealth checks until you move or take an action.
- Seasonal Bloom, choose one at character creation:  
    • Spring Bloom, once per short rest as a bonus action you or an adjacent ally restore 1d6 Vitality as you exude healing sap.  
    • Summer Canopy, you have advantage on saves against exhaustion from heat and your speed increases by 5 ft while in direct natural sunlight.  
    • Autumn Shedding, once per short rest as a reaction when a creature you can see enters your reach, drifting leaves and chaff impose −1 Base Acc on that creature until the end of its turn.  
    • Winter Dormancy, you have resistance to Cold damage and advantage on saves to endure extreme cold.
- Siege Limbs: You deal double damage to wooden structures, doors, and siege equipment.
- Flammable: You have vulnerability to Fire damage. After taking Fire damage, you continue to smolder, taking 1 fire damage at the start of each of your turns until you or an adjacent ally spends an action to douse you, you enter at least knee deep nonburning water, or 1 minute passes without taking additional Fire damage.
- Long Growth: Ents do not die from old age, they grow larger and slower over centuries. Most fail to survive past 600 - 800 years as stillness overtakes motion.
