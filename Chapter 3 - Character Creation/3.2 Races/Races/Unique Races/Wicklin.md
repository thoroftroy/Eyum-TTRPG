Description: Wicklin are living constructs made of wood, cloth, porcelain, or metal, animated by lost rites or errant sparks of magic. Button eyes, stitched smiles, joint seams, and tidy knots make many resemble toys or decorative dolls; others are cracked, patched, or plated with visible repairs. They neither breathe nor bleed, and their movements are precise but uncanny, like puppets whose strings are pulled from within. Some are lacquered and pristine; others wear scuffs and mends as a history of owners, places, and escapes. Though small and light, there is a stubborn will in the way a Wicklin squares its head and straightens a fraying seam.

Culture: Most Wicklin awaken where they were left—attics, trunks, galleries, workshops—then slip into the world to find purpose. Without ancestry, they make families from the willing: other castoffs, caravan folk, stage troupes, and traveling circuses. Settlements, when they exist, are hidden and odd—a lantern lit railcar, a grove hung with wind chimes, a cellar stitched into rooms by colored thread. Names are sacred gifts, stories are kept like stitches, and mending is a rite. Their courtesies are simple: fix what you break, carry what you can, and remember who patched you last.

Other:
- Construct Nature: You do not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. You are immune to Poison damage, the Poisoned condition, disease, and drowning or suffocation. You can still take a full rest to recover abilities.
- Mind Padding: You have resistance to Psychic damage. You are immune to magical sleep.
- Mend and Stitch: During a short rest, if you have simple materials (thread, wire, glue, or rivets), you can restore 1d6 + your Proficiency Bonus Vitality to yourself. Once per short rest.
- Still As A Toy: When you remain motionless for 1 round, you have advantage on Stealth checks to appear inanimate. Observers who spend a round examining you must succeed on a Spot check, DC 12 + your Proficiency Bonus, to realize you are alive.
- Lightweight Frame: You have advantage on checks and saving throws to escape grapples, bindings, or manacles. You can squeeze through openings as narrow as 6 inches without squeezing penalties.
- Spare Stitch: Once per long rest, when you would be critically hit by a melee attack, reduce the attack’s damage by 3 and treat it as a normal hit as seams give before snapping.
