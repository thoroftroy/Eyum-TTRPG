- Description: Wicklin are living constructs, made of wood, cloth, porcelain, or metal, but animated by unknown magic or lost rituals. Their button-like eyes, sewn joints, and stitched smiles make them resemble childrenâ€™s toys, but within lies a fierce spark of independence. Some Wicklin are pristine and elegant, while others are cracked, patched, or haphazardly repaired. Their movements are precise but eerie, and they do not breathe or bleed.
    
- Culture: Wicklin are born of abandonment, created as companions, guardians, or decorations, then left behind. Some awaken in dusty attics; others flee ruined castles or cursed workshops. Lacking ancestry, Wicklin form bonds based on shared experience, often finding solace in other outcasts. Their communities are few, scattered, and strange, built in abandoned tunnels, hidden groves, or traveling circuses. Wicklin crave meaning, stories, and memory, building families from strangers and treating names as sacred gifts.
