- Description: Mycelari are humanoid fungal beings who range between 4 and 6 feet in height. Their skin resembles smooth bark or damp stone, often mottled with ridges of spongy mycelium. Instead of hair, many grow caps, tendrils, or fronds, unique fungal growths that often reflect their age or origin. Their eyes are wide and opalescent, lacking pupils, and they emit faint bioluminescence in low light. Mycelari do not bleed, instead they exude a thick, nutrient-rich ooze when injured.
    
- Culture: Mycelari society is not structured in terms of hierarchy, but rather circles, clusters of kin linked by memory-sharing and fungal root networks. They speak rarely but listen intently, often holding counsel in stillness for hours before offering a single sentence. They prize preservation over innovation, seeing memory as sacred and repetition as a form of worship. Many Mycelari are drawn to death, not morbidly, but reverently. They tend to catacombs, burial groves, and forgotten ruins, ensuring the past is never fully lost. They are known to sing sporesongs, which convey shared memories and ancestral knowledge through harmonic fungal spores.
    
- Other: You cannot speak verbally, instead all Mycelari communicate telepathically (You may do so to any number of targets within 60 ft from you). You are also immune to poison damage. You also do not require food or drink if you instead sit in soil for several hours a day consuming the nutrients in it.Â
