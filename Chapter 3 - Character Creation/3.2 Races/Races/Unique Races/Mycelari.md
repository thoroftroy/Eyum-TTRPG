Description: Mycelari are humanoid fungal beings whose skin reads like smooth bark or damp stone, veined with spongy mycelium that compresses and springs back with each step. Hair is replaced by caps, fronds, or tendrils that mark age and origin, from shelf fungi that stack along the scalp to delicate gills that ripple when they “speak.” Eyes are opalescent and pupiless, taking in light as a soft sheen rather than a point. In darkness they glow faintly, bioluminescent threads pulsing under the surface. When injured they do not bleed; a thick nutrient ooze seeps out and seals like sap. Their gait is deliberate and heavy, better for rooting than running, and when they stand still the ground seems to welcome them back.

Culture: Mycelari organize in circles, clusters of kin linked by memory sharing and shallow root webs. Councils are held in stillness, hours of shared recall followed by a single sentence that carries the consensus of many minds. They guard memory over novelty, keeping catacombs, burial groves, and ruin gardens where loss is cataloged and tended. Songs are breathed as sporesongs, harmonics that carry images and emotions rather than words, teaching routes, seasons, and griefs all at once. Outsiders find them quiet but not cold; a Mycelari who shares a memory with you has offered something weightier than speech. Their courtesies are simple, step lightly, return what you take, and make a place for the dead to rest.

Other:
- Sporelink Telepathy: You cannot speak verbally. You communicate telepathically as images and emotions to any number of willing creatures within 60 ft that you can sense. Language is not required, but mindless creatures cannot receive your messages.
- Bioluminescence: You emit dim light in a 5 ft radius. You can suppress or resume this light as a bonus action.
- Poison Immunity: You are immune to Poison damage and the Poisoned condition. You have advantage on saving throws against disease.
- Soil Sustenance: You do not require food or drink if you spend at least 2 hours rooted in soil or rich compost each day.
- Hyphal Compression: You can squeeze through openings as narrow as 4 inches without squeezing penalties. You have advantage on checks and saving throws to escape grapples, bindings, or manacles.
- Spore Veil: Once per short rest, as an action release a 10 ft radius cloud centered on you that lasts until the start of your next turn. Creatures of your choice that begin their turn in the cloud must succeed on a CON save, DC 12 + Proficiency Bonus + CON mod, or take 1d4 poison damage and suffer −1 Base Acc until the end of their turn. The area is lightly obscured.
