| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Avian]]       | Avians are tall, lightweight birdfolk built for flight, with powerful wings, sleek feathers, and sharp avian features. They follow a spiritual culture focused on freedom and cosmic balance, living high above the world and avoiding conflict unless justice demands action. Avians excel at speed and aerial combat but are fragile on the ground and poorly suited to heavy labor or prolonged fights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Centaur]]     | Centaurs are massive, horse-bodied nomads built for speed, endurance, and momentum, combining a humanoid upper body with the power of a warhorse. Their culture is herd-based and practical, valuing oaths, shared labor, and open horizons over walls or cities. Centaurs excel at mobility, charges, and physical presence, especially in open terrain, but struggle in confined spaces and environments that limit movement or footing.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Chelonar]]    | Chelonar are slow-moving, shell-backed humanoids defined by patience, endurance, and an almost geological sense of time. Their culture values memory, long-term planning, and work meant to last centuries, with communities built into stone and shaped to survive floods, wars, and generations. They excel at defense, stability, and holding ground, but their deliberate nature and heavy bodies make them poor at speed, agility, or sudden change.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Felari]]      | Felari are agile, feline humanoids built for speed, balance, and awareness, with lithe frames, long tails, and sharp senses. Their culture values independence and curiosity, favoring loose communities and personal freedom over rigid hierarchy. Felari excel at mobility, scouting, and precision, but their light builds make them less suited to brute strength or heavy, defensive roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Fewiuo]]      | Fewiuo are winged humanoids defined by flight, grace, and personal freedom, with reverse-jointed legs, sharp talons, and powerful wings that vary widely by lineage. Their culture centers on chosen flocks, movement, and expression through motion, music, and aerial skill rather than rigid law or territory. Fewiuo excel at mobility, awareness, and aerial control, thriving in open skies and high places, but they are less suited to grounded endurance, heavy labor, or roles that demand staying power over speed and finesse.                                                                                                  |
| [[Grusk]]       | Grusk are boar-like humanoids built around strength, endurance, and sheer physical presence, with dense muscle, tusks, and bodies that are hard to move or drop. Their culture values honesty, reliability, and shared effort, favoring direct solutions and face-to-face resolution over subtlety or polish. Grusk excel at front-line roles, toughness, and sustained physical work, but they are slower, louder, and poorly suited to finesse, agility, or intellectual pursuits.                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Luroth]]      | Luroth are amphibious, frog-like humanoids with heavy frames and powerful legs, equally at home in water and on land. Their culture is patient and memory-focused, centered around rivers and shifting wetlands, where restraint and long-term thinking are prized over speed or impulse. Luroth excel at endurance, stability, and aquatic movement, but they are slower and less agile on dry land and struggle in roles that demand quick reactions or rapid change.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Naga]]        | Naga are serpentine humanoids defined by strength, speed, and calculated dominance, combining a humanoid upper body with a powerful snake-like tail. Their culture is competitive and pragmatic, valuing proven ability, leverage, and control over trust or tradition, with alliances formed strictly on mutual benefit. Naga excel at mobility, intimidation, and specialized combat roles shaped by lineage, but their ruthless social norms and physical forms make them poorly suited to cooperation-based societies or delicate, craft-focused work.                                                                                  |
| [[Nocthyr]]     | Nocthyr are bat-like humanoids built for silence and perception, with membrane wings, keen hearing, and bodies adapted to darkness and height. Their culture values restraint, cooperation, and careful observation, favoring withdrawal or quiet resolution over open conflict. Nocthyr excel as scouts, watchers, and messengers in low-light environments, but struggle in bright conditions and prolonged, head-on combat.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Stingerfolk]] | Stingerfolk are massive, scorpion-tailed humanoids built for discipline, formation fighting, and relentless endurance, their chitinous bodies and venomous stings making them terrifying in close combat. Their culture is rigid, martial, and oath-bound, valuing order, precision, and loyalty over individual expression, with every member trained to fulfill a specific role within the hive or warband. Stingerfolk excel at frontline control, grappling, and sustained combat in harsh environments, but their size, social rigidity, and poor adaptability make them ill-suited to subtlety, diplomacy, or flexible utility roles. |
| [[Strigari]]    | Strigari are owl-like avian humanoids shaped by silence, memory, and judgment, built to move unseen and hear what others miss. Their culture treats record-keeping and oaths as sacred, with authority rooted in precedent and carefully measured speech rather than force or popularity. Strigari excel at observation, stealth, and nocturnal operations, but their rigid pride, physical frailty, and social inflexibility make them poorly suited to brute combat or cooperative leadership.                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Thryz]]       | Thryz are four-armed, insectoid humanoids built for speed, coordination, and lethal efficiency, their chitinous bodies and bladed forelimbs making them terrifyingly precise in motion. Their hive-based culture values function, honesty, and collective purpose above all else, with social roles earned through demonstrated ability rather than birth or status. Thryz excel at rapid combat, multitasking, and disciplined teamwork, but their alien mindset, rigid literalism, and unsettling presence make social integration and diplomacy difficult outside their own kind.                                                        |
| [[Veltraxi]]    | Veltraxi are sharp-eyed, avian humanoids shaped by scavenging, secrecy, and survival, known for mimicry, quick hands, and restless awareness. Their loose flock culture values information, adaptability, and clever problem-solving over hierarchy or honor, thriving in ruins, cliffs, and forgotten places. Veltraxi excel at infiltration, spying, and mobility, but their light builds, short lifespans, and mistrusted reputation leave them ill-suited to direct confrontation or stable, law-bound societies.                                                                                                                       |
### Humanoid Races

| Race            | General Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Aurian]]      | Aurians are pale, rune-obsessed humanoids whose flawless symmetry, red eyes, and faint inner glow mark them as something deliberately engineered rather than naturally evolved. Their culture is rigid, scholarly, and intensely hierarchical, built around arcane study, runic mastery, and generational competition for intellectual dominance. Aurians excel at magic, analysis, and long-term planning, but their emotional distance, insularity, and ruthless academic politics leave them poorly suited to improvisation, empathy-driven leadership, or life outside controlled, ordered environments.                                                                                                                  |
| [[Broodweaver]] | Broodweavers are unsettling, multi-eyed humanoids whose biology allows them to spawn small, obedient broodlings for scouting, harassment, and control. Their culture is quiet, transient, and survival-focused, favoring anonymity, short-term alliances, and living in dense urban shadows where they can disappear easily. Broodweavers excel at information gathering, battlefield control through minions, and operating in crowded or confined spaces, but their physical weakness, vulnerability to heat, and deeply mistrusted nature make direct combat and open leadership difficult.                                                                                                                                |
| [[Dwarf]]       | Dwarves are compact, stone-solid folk built for endurance, craft, and unwavering resolve, with powerful frames and a presence that feels rooted to the ground itself. Their culture centers on craftsmanship, oath-keeping, and legacy, measuring worth through what is built, finished, and upheld over generations rather than words or displays. Dwarves excel at resilience, physical labor, and creating things that last, but their slowness to change, long memories for grudges, and emotional reserve can make adaptation and reconciliation difficult.                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Elf]]         | Elves are long-lived, graceful humanoids whose lives unfold at a slower, more deliberate rhythm than most other peoples. Their culture treats life as an art to be refined over centuries, valuing beauty, precision, and meaning in word, craft, and action rather than urgency or accumulation. Elves excel at awareness, finesse, and long-term pursuits of magic, diplomacy, and tradition, but their distance from short-lived perspectives and physical fragility can make them seem detached, impractical, or slow to respond when immediacy is required.                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Elnar]]       | Elnars are forest-touched humanoids whose bodies reflect living seasons, bark-skinned, leaf-haired, and always in quiet motion with the natural world. Their culture is fluid and communal, organized around seasonal movement, song, humor, and shared stewardship rather than permanent settlements or rigid authority. Elnars excel in natural environments, adaptability, and social cohesion, but their aversion to rigid structures, heavy craft, and destructive industry can leave them at odds with more urban or utilitarian societies.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Ferramite]]   | Ferramites are living constructs of metal and will, forged bodies animated by discipline, endurance, and a strict code of martial honor. Their culture treats combat as an honest language, valuing consent, restraint, and witnessed trials over brutality or conquest. Ferramites excel at frontline combat, durability, and controlled dueling, but their rigid codes, heavy builds, and preference for clear rules make subtlety, improvisation, and fluid social maneuvering more difficult outside structured conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Giant]]       | Giants are colossal humanoids shaped by scale, endurance, and instinctive strength, moving through the world with the weight and certainty of living terrain. Their culture is blunt, physical, and immediate, built around contests of strength, simple rules, and honest confrontation rather than planning or subtlety. Giants excel at raw power, resilience, and intimidation, but their size, lack of finesse, and impatience with complexity make cooperation, strategy, and delicate problem-solving difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Halofade]]    | Halofade are light-touched humanoids who exist half a step out of alignment with the world, drifting through cities and crossroads with an air of casual unreality. Their culture is nomadic and informal, built around favors, precision movement, and absolute reliability rather than territory or hierarchy. Halofade excel at mobility, infiltration, and getting exactly where they need to be, but their physical frailty, detachment, and lack of rooted community leave them poorly suited to endurance, direct confrontation, or long-term stewardship roles.                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Human]]       | Humans are adaptable, varied, and relentlessly driven, defined less by shared traits and more by their ability to change, learn, and persist. Their cultures are wildly diverse and constantly evolving, shaped by environment, necessity, and experimentation rather than tradition alone. Humans excel at versatility, improvisation, and rallying others around a cause, but their urgency, inconsistency, and tendency to overreach often lead to conflict, instability, or hard-earned lessons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Iceborn]]     | Iceborn are cold-touched humanoids shaped by endurance, restraint, and quiet strength, their pale forms and frost-marked presence reflecting lives spent in harsh climates. Their culture values patience, communal responsibility, and guidance through example rather than command, with tradition rooted in survival, rune study, and mutual aid. Iceborn excel at resilience, mental discipline, and operating in extreme environments, but their reserved nature and slow-burning approach can make rapid adaptation and expressive leadership difficult in warmer, faster societies.                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Ignites]]     | Ignites are heat-born humanoids whose bodies radiate living fire, their lives shaped by constant restraint over overwhelming power. Their culture is ritualistic and disciplined, centered on self-mastery, purpose, and survival in extreme volcanic environments rather than conquest or expansion. Ignites excel at fire-based endurance, purification, and controlled bursts of speed or destruction, but their dependence on heat, short lifespans, and vulnerability to cold make long-term travel and sustained exposure to gentler climates difficult.                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Kravari]]     | Kravari are disciplined, militaristic humanoids defined by structure, training, and earned authority, with sharp features and a constant readiness for command. Their culture blends warfare, engineering, and philosophy into a single tradition where competence determines status and loyalty is forged through shared service. Kravari excel at coordinated combat, leadership under pressure, and strategic thinking, but their rigid hierarchies and intimidating demeanor can hinder flexibility, empathy, and trust with less martial societies.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Lumari]]      | Lumari are radiant humanoids whose bodies and cultures are shaped by light as both symbol and substance, carrying an innate glow and an air of deliberate grace. Their society prizes clarity, honesty, and moral purpose, teaching that illumination, revealing truth and guiding others, is a civic duty as much as a spiritual one. Lumari excel at leadership by example, healing, and light-based magic, but their rigid ideals and distance from practical, physical concerns can make them inflexible or overbearing in harsher, more pragmatic cultures.                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Nyctaris]]    | Nyctaris are living shadows given thought and intent, existing half between the material world and the Nyxrealm where light cannot follow. Their culture revolves around subtlety, mischief, and boundary-testing, using cleverness and patience rather than force, with strict personal rules about when true harm is justified. Nyctaris excel at stealth, traversal of darkness, and information control, but their aversion to light, inability to function in bright spaces, and indirect relationship with the physical world make straightforward combat and open environments deeply unfavorable for them.                                                                                                            |
| [[Opkathian]]   | Opkathians are wild-blooded humanoids shaped by instinct, motion, and open land, built to run far, listen closely, and strike decisively when pressed. Their culture rejects permanence and hierarchy, favoring shifting leadership, seasonal paths, and loyalty proven through shared hardship rather than words or law. Opkathians excel at mobility, survival, and adapting to natural environments, but their disdain for structure, planning, and crafted systems often puts them at odds with settled, industrial, or highly organized societies.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Sandmen]]     | Sandmen are psionic humanoids who navigate dreams and waking minds with equal ease, their calm, alien features reflecting a life spent half in sleep and half in secrets. Their culture is fragmented and transactional, favoring anonymity, leverage, and short-term cooperation over loyalty or nationhood, with many operating as dream-walkers, interrogators, or quiet problem-solvers in crowded cities. Sandmen excel at mental manipulation, information gathering, and resisting psychological influence, but their distrust of permanence and reliance on indirect power leave them ill-suited to physical confrontation or long-term communal leadership.                                                          |
| [[Snerin]]      | Snerin are dense, stone-built humanoids engineered for pressure, precision, and endurance, with bodies and minds shaped by deep tunnels and relentless work. Their culture prizes engineering, tested logic, and things that last, measuring worth by machines that function and designs that endure heat, weight, and time. Snerin excel at crafting, problem-solving under harsh conditions, and resisting physical displacement or mental manipulation, but their sensitivity to bright light, cautious isolationism, and lack of flexibility make surface life and rapid social adaptation difficult.                                                                                                                     |
| [[Spritelings]] | Spritelings are tiny, frenetic humanoids who survive by speed, proximity, and opportunism, latching onto larger forces and thriving in the margins they leave behind. Their culture is parasitic but practical, forming around protection, imitation, and sheer numbers rather than heritage or planning, with loyalty lasting only as long as it remains useful. Spritelings excel at harassment, evasion, and compounding pressure through repeated actions, but their extreme fragility, poor discipline, and lack of foresight make them unreliable alone and dangerous mostly when underestimated or ignored.                                                                                                            |
| [[Sylphmare]]   | Sylphmares are gaunt, slow-moving humanoids steeped in exhaustion and shadow, their ashen skin, hollow eyes, and hushed presence making spaces feel quieter simply by their arrival. Their culture is sparse and inward-facing, built around silence, endurance, and honest survival rather than joy or ambition. Living alone or in tiny circles, they value presence over promises and truth over comfort, expressing themselves through minimal, piercing art and introspective magic. Sylphmares excel at stealth, resilience, and operating in darkness, but their frailty, oppressive aura, and difficulty functioning in light or fast-paced environments make cooperation and conventional combat deeply challenging. |
| [[Varkun]]      | Varkun are infernally touched humanoids marked by horns, tails, ember-lit skin, and a constant undercurrent of heat that betrays their lineage. Shaped by life on the margins, their culture centers on clan loyalty, earned authority, and survival through competence rather than law or mercy. Long mistrusted and often hunted, they turn reputation into armor and treat oaths as binding currency within their enclaves. Varkun excel at social leverage, fire resilience, and decisive close combat, but their stigma, volatile presence, and strained relationship with softer or more idealistic societies make trust, diplomacy, and integration an ongoing struggle.                                               |
| [[Zephar]]      | Zephar are dense, earth-toned humanoids built for endurance, repetition, and unglamorous strength, their squat frames and grit-worn skin shaped by labor rather than battle or art. Their culture treats work as proof of worth, valuing reliability, shared effort, and systems that function over beauty, ambition, or cleverness. Zephar excel at sustained labor, holding ground, and methodical combat where consistency wins over speed, but their rigidity, blunt communication, and distrust of abstraction or flashy magic make adaptation, creativity-driven problem solving, and social subtlety difficult.                                                                                                        |
| [[Zontian]]     | Zontians are calm, luminous humanoids shaped by ritual, balance, and service, carrying an innate steadiness that slows haste and sharpens judgment around them. Their culture is deeply ceremonial, treating tradition, harmony with the world, and earned wisdom as anchors against chaos rather than tools for dominance. Zontians excel at guidance, support, and long-term stability, bolstering allies and resisting mental influence, but their aversion to raw physicality and preference for measured action leave them less effective in brute-force combat or situations that demand aggressive immediacy.                                                                                                          |

| [[Boaf]]          | Boaf are towering, tusked humanoids built for intimidation, control, and calculated violence, combining heavy muscle with a predatory tactical mindset. Their culture revolves around dominance, efficiency, and transactional loyalty, valuing pressure, positioning, and fear as tools as important as raw strength. Boaf excel at battlefield command, morale breaking, and leading through intimidation and structure, but their reliance on fear, rigid power dynamics, and lack of empathy make long-term alliances, subtle diplomacy, and trust-based cooperation difficult to sustain.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Brogath]]       | Brogath are massive, furred humanoids built for explosive strength, grappling, and relentless close combat, combining predatory speed with crushing physical power. Their culture is trial-based and merit-driven, where leadership is proven through visible action, duels, and shared hardship rather than inheritance or rhetoric. Brogath excel at shock assaults, frontline dominance, and coordinated pack fighting, but their reliance on brute force, limited patience for planning, and low tolerance for subtlety or diplomacy make prolonged strategy, negotiation, and complex social maneuvering difficult.                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Cyclops]]       | Cyclopes are colossal, one-eyed humanoids built for lifting, breaking, and siege labor, their immense strength and single-minded focus making them living engines of construction and destruction. Their culture prizes direct work, reliability, and measurable results, with status earned by solving large problems through effort rather than cunning or diplomacy. Cyclopes excel at hauling, demolition, and anti-structure combat, but their poor depth perception, lack of subtlety, and limited ranged precision make finesse, stealth, and complex coordination difficult outside straightforward, force-driven roles.                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Galdrani]]      | Galdrani are towering, forest-bound humanoids who embody patience, stewardship, and the slow authority of living land, their moss-covered bodies and antlered forms marking them as caretakers rather than conquerors. Their culture centers on animistic balance and long-term guardianship, favoring groves, rites, and deliberate intervention over cities or domination. Galdrani excel at area control, endurance, and defending natural terrain, but their slow decision-making, aversion to industry, and limited adaptability make fast-paced politics, urban life, and utilitarian craft-focused societies difficult for them to navigate.                                                                                                              |
| [[Gorul]]         | Gorul are hulking, tusked humanoids defined by brute strength, endurance, and relentless forward pressure, their scarred bodies and disciplined movement marking them as living battering rams. Their culture values shared burden, proven reliability, and strength expressed through work as much as war, binding warbands by oath, labor, and example rather than blood. Gorul excel at frontline combat, breaking formations, and building or fortifying under pressure, but their size, direct mindset, and limited patience for abstraction make subtle diplomacy, finesse roles, and complex arcane or bureaucratic systems difficult for them to navigate.                                                                                               |
| [[Grivlit]]       | Grivlits are small, hyper-agile humanoids driven by improvisation, scavenging, and relentless cleverness, their wiry frames and scheming eyes always searching for the next angle. Their culture thrives on loose collectives, shifting influence, and plans that succeed through audacity rather than structure, valuing ingenuity and adaptability over loyalty or order. Grivlits excel at infiltration, sabotage, tinkering, and navigating tight or chaotic environments, but their physical frailty, short attention spans, and disdain for stability make them unreliable in prolonged fights, disciplined formations, or long-term leadership roles.                                                                                                     |
| [[Grull]]         | Grull are enormous, impact-driven humanoids built almost entirely for brute force, their slabbed bodies and leathery hides turning them into living siege engines. They lack independent societies, instead serving as hired muscle or enforcers within stronger hierarchies, valuing simple rewards, clear orders, and opportunities to break things. Grull excel at smashing defenses, holding choke points, and intimidating through sheer presence, but their poor magical aptitude, low social awareness, and reliance on others for direction make them ineffective at strategy, diplomacy, or self-governed leadership.                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Harpy]]         | Harpies are feral, winged ambushers driven by hunger and dominance, relying on speed, flight, and swarm tactics rather than planning or restraint. Their crude flock culture revolves around raiding, killing, and taking whatever can be carried, with rank decided by violence and success in the hunt. Harpies excel at hit-and-run attacks, aerial harassment, and preying on the isolated or weak, but their lack of discipline, intelligence, and cooperation makes them unreliable, short-sighted, and ineffective against organized resistance or prolonged conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Minotaur]]      | Minotaurs are massive, bull-headed humanoids built for momentum, endurance, and territorial control, combining great strength with an innate sense of direction and space. Their labyrinth-centered culture prizes honesty, oath-keeping, and mastery of terrain, teaching every member to navigate complex environments by instinct and memory. Minotaurs excel at charges, frontline disruption, and guarding routes or strongholds, especially in confined or maze-like terrain, but their size, lower agility, and limited aptitude for subtlety or abstract planning make delicate diplomacy, stealth, and rapid adaptation more difficult.                                                                                                                 |
| [[Mireglopians]]  | Mireglopians are amorphous, slime-bodied humanoids defined by fluid form, extreme physical resilience, and adaptability, able to reshape themselves to suit the moment rather than conform to fixed anatomy. Their culture rejects coercion and permanence, organizing into flexible “Pools” that form and dissolve by consent, with promises valued precisely because they are never forced. Mireglopians excel in environments that reward endurance, flexibility, and unconventional problem-solving, especially aquatic or confined spaces, but their extreme sensitivity to heat and cold, along with difficulty engaging in rigid hierarchy or abstract planning, makes structured societies and harsh climates dangerous or exhausting for them.          |
| [[Naram-Sin]]     | Naram-Sin are massive, orc-like humanoids bred for violence, dominance, and relentless warfare, their towering frames and predatory instincts making them living engines of slaughter. Their culture is entirely war-driven, organized into disciplined warbands where leadership is earned through a balance of strength, cunning, and command, and replaced instantly when it fails. Naram-Sin excel at frontline destruction, fear-based control, and momentum-driven combat, chaining kills and overwhelming foes through brutality and coordination, but their absolute fixation on conquest, lack of mercy, and incompatibility with peaceful or cooperative societies make them unstable allies and catastrophic neighbors outside a battlefield context. |
| [[Salamandrians]] | Salamandrians are small, heat-adapted reptilian humanoids built for endurance, speed, and survival in extreme environments, their compact frames and fireproof biology allowing them to outlast larger foes on hot ground. Their culture is harsh, pragmatic, and endurance-driven, organized around warmth, pursuit, and relentless forward motion, with respect earned through stamina and refusal to yield. Salamandrians excel at sustained physical effort, fire resistance, and operating in punishing climates, but their vulnerability to cold, abrasive social norms, and poor aptitude for abstract thinking or diplomacy make them ill-suited to cold regions or cooperative, trust-based societies.                                                  |
| [[Siren]]         | Sirens are amphibious, predatory humanoids who weaponize beauty, voice, and coordinated ambush to hunt travelers along coasts and waterways. Their culture is explicitly violent and sport-driven, organized into small shoals that value confirmed kills, secrecy, and efficient relocation over territory or trade. Sirens excel at aquatic mobility, charm-based lures, and underwater combat control, but their dependence on water, inability to function long-term on land, and total incompatibility with cooperative or mercantile societies make them dangerous outsiders and persistent maritime threats.                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Slarik]]        | Slarik are small, amphibious humanoids adapted to reefs, flooded ruins, and tidal tunnels, built for maneuvering through tight, waterlogged spaces with speed and coordination. Their clan-based culture emphasizes communal labor, memory through song, and collective defense of waterways and spawning grounds, with trust earned through adaptability rather than contracts. Slarik excel at underwater scouting, terrain control, and pod-based skirmishing, but their reliance on aquatic environments and insular social norms make extended life in dry, rigid societies difficult.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Stonekin]]      | Stonekin are ancient, living constructs of stone and crystal, shaped by geological pressure rather than birth and defined by immense endurance and longevity. Their solitary culture treats conflict and hardship as necessary proof of purpose, with identity forged through trials against beasts, elements, or worthy rivals rather than community or tradition. Stonekin excel at durability, raw physical presence, and surviving extreme conditions, but their ponderous nature, social detachment, and lack of adaptability make cooperation, subtlety, and intellectual pursuits difficult.                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Thauryx]]       | Thauryx are draconic humanoids defined by plated scales, elemental breath, and a rigid culture of oaths and lineage tracing back to ancient wyrms. Their society prizes mastery, discipline, and honor earned through deeds, with leadership bound to decisive action and control over inner power. Thauryx excel at front line combat, elemental pressure, and commanding presence, but their pride, oath-bound rigidity, and elemental biases can limit flexibility, diplomacy, and adaptation outside clan traditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Troll]]         | Trolls are massive, regenerating humanoids driven by hunger, fear, and dominance, their rubbery flesh healing almost as fast as it is torn. They live as bullies and claim-takers in ruins and wild shadows, following whoever proves strongest most recently. Trolls excel at brute endurance, attrition, and terror through regeneration, but their weakness to sunlight, fire, and radiant power, along with poor intellect and discipline, makes them unreliable allies and vulnerable when their healing is denied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Tull]]          | Tull are small, wiry swarm-humanoids who survive through numbers, speed, and shameless opportunism rather than individual strength. They live as scavengers and raiders, clustering around stronger leaders and overwhelming foes through persistence and pack tactics. Tull excel at harassment, theft, and swarming pressure in close quarters, but their poor intellect, weak individual power, and heavy magical penalties make them ineffective alone and unreliable in structured societies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| [[Ent]]         | Ents are massive, tree-born humanoids embodying living forests, shaped by bark, sap, and slow-growing wisdom. Their culture is rooted in patience and stewardship rather than settlement, tending groves, guiding natural balance, and remembering land across centuries. Ents excel at endurance, area control, and environmental dominance, especially in natural terrain, but their immense size, slow speed, and extreme vulnerability to fire make urban life, crafted systems, and rapid response roles difficult for them.                                                                                                |
| [[Mirr]]        | Mirr are shapeshifting humanoids who treat identity as a practiced craft rather than a fixed truth, able to sculpt their bodies, voices, and mannerisms to pass as almost anyone. Their culture centers on secrecy, consent, and mastery of masks, with clans enforcing strict rules to prevent deception from turning inward. Mirr excel at infiltration, impersonation, and social manipulation, thriving as spies, mediators, and escape artists, but their lack of physical power, vulnerability to scrutiny under bright light, and reliance on preparation make prolonged combat and blunt-force roles poor fits for them. |
| [[Mycelari]]    | Mycelari are slow-moving, fungal humanoids bound to soil, memory, and shared thought, communicating through telepathic images rather than speech. Their culture centers on preservation—of history, of the dead, and of balance—using memory circles and spore-songs to pass knowledge across generations. Mycelari excel at endurance, resilience, and environmental control through spores and rooting, but their very low mobility, vulnerability to fire, and inability to communicate verbally make fast-paced combat, travel, and conventional diplomacy difficult.                                                        |
| [[Noskara]]     | Noskara are refined, vampiric humanoids who wield patience, etiquette, and predation with equal precision. Their culture revolves around rigid codes, long memory, and social dominance, treating oaths and appearances as binding tools of power. Noskara excel at manipulation, control, and sustained pressure through charm and blood siphoning, but their undead nature, radiant vulnerability, and reliance on restraint over force make open conflict and reckless environments dangerous for them.                                                                                                                       |
| [[Relicwraith]] | Relicwraiths are incorporeal, mana-bound entities tethered to a single physical Anchor, existing through projection, telekinesis, and disciplined magical control rather than flesh. Their culture is solitary and ritualized, built around secrecy, glyphwork, and strict etiquette to protect their Anchors and accumulated memory. Relicwraiths excel at spellcasting, manipulation at range, and survival through avoidance and immunity, but their reliance on a vulnerable Anchor, inability to engage physically, and dormancy when depleted make direct confrontation and careless exposure extremely dangerous.         |
| [[Skinwalker]]  | Skinwalkers are near-human shapeshifters who survive by blending in, replacing faces, and disappearing before scrutiny can settle. Their culture is decentralized and pragmatic, built around rotating identities, safe-names, and learned behavior rather than blood or tradition. Skinwalkers excel at infiltration, impersonation, and social manipulation, but their lack of raw physical resilience, vulnerability to careful inspection, and reliance on secrecy make open combat, prolonged attention, and overt craftsmanship risky for them.                                                                            |
| [[Wicklin]]     | Wicklin are small, animated constructs—dolls, toys, and crafted figures given will by stray magic or forgotten rites. Lacking ancestry or nation, they form found families among other castoffs and travelers, valuing repair, memory, and chosen names over bloodline. Wicklin excel at resilience through ingenuity, stealth through stillness, and utility in tight or overlooked spaces, but their fragile frames, aversion to fire, and limited physical strength make direct combat and heavy labor dangerous for them.                                                                                                    |

| [[Halfling]]               | Halflings are rare cross-blooded descendants of two different races, inheriting mixed physical traits and cultural markers from both parents rather than a fixed form of their own. Their existence is often met with prejudice, viewed as lesser or unstable by purist societies, leaving most Halflings to grow up on the margins or among outsiders. Halflings are mechanically volatile, gaining all statistical bonuses and penalties from both parent races and inheriting every weakness, while only partially benefiting from racial strengths, making them highly specialized but often fragile characters shaped heavily by lineage choice.                            |
| [[Rotborn]]                | Rotborn are mindless undead animated by rot and necromantic impulse, driven only to seek and destroy the living. They retain the rough shape and physical capabilities of their former bodies, but decay steadily and move with clumsy inevitability. Rotborn excel at attrition, swarming, and spreading Rot Infection through their bite, rising again and again unless burned or purified, but they lack intelligence, coordination, and free will, functioning only as shambling hazards or expendable weapons under necromancer control.                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Therianthropes]]         | Therianthropes are stable humanoid–animal hybrids whose bodies and instincts partially express a specific animal lineage, blending humanoid form with functional bestial traits such as tails, ears, talons, wings, or enhanced senses. Their culture varies widely by region: some societies value them as scouts, hunters, or champions, while others distrust them as unpredictable or dangerous. Therianthropism is a recessive, heritable condition tied to a single animal line, and while it does not override the base race’s identity or affinities, it adds distinct physical advantages and instincts that shape how a Therianthrope moves, fights, and is perceived. |
| [[Veythari]]               | Veythari are living mortals transformed by vampiric vitae, retaining their original race while gaining predatory traits, blood dependency, and unnerving physical precision. Their culture is secretive and fragmented, defined by strict etiquette, hunger management, and the constant need to remain hidden among mortals or within nocturnal enclaves. Veythari excel at stealth, charm, mobility, and survivability through regeneration and later flight, but are constrained by blood requirements, radiant vulnerability, sunlight exposure, and the social danger of exposure or excess.                                                                                |
| [[Werewolf (Lycanthrope)]] | Werewolves are mortals bound to a lunar predator, living between restraint and feral instinct. By day they pass as their base race; by night or stress they can assume a hybrid form built for speed, scent, and the chase. Their cultures form secret moon-lodges that prize control, oaths, and responsible hunting, policing their own as fiercely as any outsider. Werewolves excel at pursuit, close-quarters combat, and teamwork through pack instincts, but their vulnerability to silver, risk of losing control, and stigma force them into secrecy and careful self-discipline.                                                                                       |
| [[Witherkin]]              | Witherkin are sentient undead corpses reanimated by necrotic force, retaining reason and will but not their former memories. Shunned and rare, they exist on society’s edges as mercenaries, wardens, or solitary rulers of lesser dead, bound by strict personal codes rather than compassion. Witherkin excel at endurance, survivability, and attrition through repeated resurrection and necrotic resilience, but suffer slowed movement, radiant vulnerability, dependence on raw flesh to maintain cohesion, and eventual bodily decay over centuries.                                                                                                                     |
