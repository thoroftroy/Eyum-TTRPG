Your background represents your character’s life before the events of the campaign, their career, experiences, and skills. Backgrounds are typically chosen in collaboration with your Game Master (GM) and primarily serve a narrative purpose. While they generally don’t provide mechanical benefits, you and your GM may agree on minor stat boosts or advantages if it fits the story.

##### Function of Backgrounds

The main function of a background is to grant advantage on tasks your character would logically excel at due to their past experiences. For example:

- A Chef would have advantage on cooking-related tasks (if they’ve worked with the ingredients before).
    
- A Blacksmith would have advantage on crafting or repairing weapons and armor.
    

GM Discretion: The GM has the final say on whether a background grants advantage. If the GM rules that your background doesn’t apply to a specific situation, you won’t gain advantage.
