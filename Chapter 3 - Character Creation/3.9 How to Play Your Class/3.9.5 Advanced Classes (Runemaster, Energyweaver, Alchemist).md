#### Advanced Class: Runemaster

Your Job: Set up magic in advance, then unleash it with perfect timing.

How It Works:

- You don’t cast spells on the spot, you inscribe runes.
    
- You use Arcana checks to create powerful rune circles during a long rest.
    
- In battle, you trigger these runes or create traps/sigils on the fly.
    

What You Do Each Turn:

- Trigger a rune you prepared, or inscribe a new one (if you have time).
    
- Use Bonus Actions to place runes, reactions to trigger effects.
    
- Stay in the back and plan your battlefield.
    

Key Tips:

- If you're not good at planning, Runemaster may be too complex.
    
- Runes are powerful but take time to set up, prepare before fights.
    
- Learn how each rune works, rune combos matter.
    
- Work closely with your GM, they’ll help decide the rune’s effects.
    
- Make runic circles wherever possible as they are much more powerful
    

#### Advanced Class: Energyweaver

Your Job: Use science to manipulate real-world energy like heat, motion, and electricity.

How It Works:

- Instead of spells, you move energy from one thing to another.
    
- Every turn, you decide:
    

- What energy to move (fire, motion, electricity)
    
- Where it comes from
    
- Where it goes
    

- You have a Joule Limit (max energy per turn) based on level.
    

What You Do Each Turn:

- Choose an Energy Action (like Thermal Transfer).
    
- Declare your source, target, and reaction.
    
- Roll to hit or succeed, depending on the effect.
    
- Apply damage, utility effect, or condition.
    

Key Tips:

- Energy must follow physics, heat comes from fire, motion from falling.
    
- Misusing energy can hurt you. Reactions matter.
    
- You don’t use Mana, you use Joules and Affinity points.
    
- Start with one Energy type (e.g., Thermal) and learn it well.
    

#### Advanced Class: Alchemist

Your Job: Use bombs, potions, and chemicals to control the battlefield.

How It Works:

- You don’t cast spells, you brew formulas before a fight.
    
- Each day, you choose which bombs or potions to prepare.
    
- In combat, you throw bombs, heal allies, or apply toxins.
    

What You Do Each Turn:

- Use an action to throw a bomb or apply a chemical.
    
- Use bonus actions to trigger passive effects or support moves.
    
- Stay mobile and out of melee range.
    

Key Tips:

- Preparation is everything, you can’t brew mid-combat.
    
- Keep track of what bombs/potions you’ve brewed each day.
    
- Most damage and utility comes from how creatively you combine effects.
