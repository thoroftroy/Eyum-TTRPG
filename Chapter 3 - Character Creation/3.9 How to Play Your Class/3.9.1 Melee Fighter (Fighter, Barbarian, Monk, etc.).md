Your Job: Soak up damage and dish it back. You’re usually on the front line.

What You Do Each Turn:

- Move to the nearest enemy (use your Speed).
    
- Attack using your melee weapon.
    
- Use Bonus Actions if you have class features (e.g., Monk’s Flurry, Barbarian’s Rage).
    
- Use Reactions to attack enemies leaving your range.
    

Key Tips:

- Stay close to enemies so they don’t target your weaker allies.
    
- If you’re low on HP, retreat and use Dodge or ask for healing.
    
- Use terrain (cover, difficult terrain) to your advantage.
    
- Most of your power comes from weapon choice and positioning.
