Your Job: Control the battlefield, heal allies, or destroy enemies from a distance.

What You Do Each Turn:

- Choose a spell based on the situation.
    
- Spend Mana and roll to hit (or apply effects if no roll is needed).
    
- Use movement to avoid danger.
    
- Bonus Actions for subclass powers or buffs.
    
- Reactions for defensive spells or counterspells.
    

Key Tips:

- You are very powerful but fragile. Stay back.
    
- Donâ€™t waste Mana, save big spells for emergencies.
    
- Positioning is key: AoE spells work best when enemies are grouped.
    
- Clerics and Druids must follow their god/nature or lose magic.
