Gore, the embodiment of unrelenting slaughter and sadistic pleasure, grants spells that fuel berserk rage, manipulate blood, and tear enemies apart in gruesome fashion.

- Domain: Blood, Carnage
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Evil
    
- Symbol: A bloodied cleaver
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Gore become avatars of unrelenting slaughter, reveling in the thrill of bloodshed and the chaos of battle. Their pacts grant grotesque strength and the power to manipulate blood, but also incite a berserker madness that demands violence. To serve Gore is to embrace carnage without restraint, to tear through enemies in a frenzy, and to offer each kill as tribute. His warlocks thrive in close combat, often losing themselves to the thrill of it, rewarded with healing, power, and destruction. Gore favors those who never hesitate to kill, who wade into war with laughter, and who see every drop of blood as sacred.
