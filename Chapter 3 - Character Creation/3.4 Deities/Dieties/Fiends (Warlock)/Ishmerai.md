Ishmerai, the sadistic architect of torment, grants spells that drain vitality, prolong agony, and curse the soul.

- Domain: Death, Suffering
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Evil
    
- Symbol: A red skull with horns
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Ishmerai become instruments of torment, wielding pain as both weapon and offering. His pacts are sealed in agony, requiring a soul each year (at minimum), and his gifts manifest as soul-crushing afflictions, vitality-draining curses, and spells that prolong suffering beyond death. Ishmerai rewards those who spread misery, manipulate the desperate with cruel deals, and desecrate hope. His warlocks are often cold, calculating tormentors who inflict pain not in haste, but with artful intent. To serve Ishmerai is to embrace anguish, to offer suffering as tribute, and to wear the screams of others like a crown of devotion.
