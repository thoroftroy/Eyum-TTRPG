Ruinax, the harbinger of annihilation, grants spells that unravel existence, create widespread devastation, and fuel destruction with unchecked power.

- Domain: Destruction, Chaos
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Evil
    
- Symbol: A flaming world crumbling apart
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Ruinax are agents of annihilation, wielding volatile magic that rends reality itself. Their pacts grant devastating force and catastrophic spells, but demand destruction in return. To serve Ruinax is to tear down structure, burn away meaning, and leave ruin wherever you walk. His followers are mad prophets of entropy, demolishing cities, collapsing civilizations, and reveling in chaos. Ruinax rewards those who create disorder on a grand scale, who obliterate the unbreakable, and who leave nothing behind but ash and silence. There is no loyalty, no purpose, only the beauty of unraveling everything that is.
