Onesimos, the trickster fiend of fate and risk, grants magic that manipulates probability, twists fortune, and forces enemies into high-stakes wagers.

- Domain: Gambling, Luck
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Neutral
    
- Symbol: A dice showing 6 and 1
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Onesimos treat magic as a gamble and power as a prize won on a crooked table. He offers luck in bursts, rerolls, reversals, impossible victories, but demands risk, chaos, and style in return. His followers are bold, reckless, and theatrical, often sealing their pacts over rigged games or impossible odds. Onesimos rewards those who disrupt order, bait others into dangerous bets, and throw themselves into the unknown with a grin. Whether they win or lose matters less than how loudly the dice clatter, he favors those who live like the world is a casino and fate is always watching.
