Lucifer, the eternal general of endless battle, grants spells that enhance warriors, fuel relentless combat, and ensure that war never ceases.

- Domain: War, Bloodshed
    
- Alignment: Lawful Evil
    
- Symbol: A black sword dripping in blood
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Lucifer march into battle as living engines of war, empowered to fight harder, longer, and without mercy. Their pacts are bound by oaths of conquest, granting strength and relentless drive in exchange for eternal conflict. To serve Lucifer is to embrace endless warfare, not for justice or vengeance, but because war is the natural state of existence. His faithful are ruthless commanders and bloodied champions, rewarded for never retreating and punishing weakness in others. Lucifer blesses those who dominate the battlefield, revive fallen soldiers only to keep the war going, and who see peace as failure, not relief.
