The fungal dreamer of decay, spores, and collective memory, Mycelith grants spells that blur reality, preserve false histories, and spread psychic rot across the mind.

- Domain: Memory, Fungal Dream, Restoration
    
- Alignment: True Neutral
    
- Symbol: A mushroom with branching mycelium forming a circle around a hollow core
    
- Behavior: Warlocks of Mycelith do not chant or pray. They listen. They dream. They walk among the dead not to raise them, but to sustain the illusion that they never left. Mycelith grants its power to those who preserve, recreate, or mend broken things, memories, people, patterns. But it is also a force of decay and repetition. Its servants must be careful: the more they mimic the past, the more they risk becoming lost within it. Some Dreamers wander villages long since erased, speaking to children no one sees. Others keep books of false memories, or maintain loops of behavior that hold something dark and holy at bay.
    

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Spores of Memory

Effect:

Once per turn, you may invoke Mycelith’s dream-mind to replicate or restore a fading truth. Choose one of the following:

- Echoform: As a Reaction, create a translucent illusion of yourself in a space you just occupied. This echo can take the hit from one attack targeting you, allowing you to dodge an attack. Lasts 1 turn.
    
- Fungal Recall: You may cast any Warlock spell you have already cast this day again without expending mana. This can be used once per Long Rest.
    
- Rotten Presence: Force a creature within 30 ft to make a Wisdom Save (DC = 10 + Warlock level) or suffer -2 to AC and Saving Throws until the start of your next turn, as phantom roots slow their body and mind.
    

Limitations:

- You may only use one of these effects per turn.
    
- Fungal Recall requires that the spell’s mana cost does not exceed 15.
    
- Echoform and Rotten Presence may be used a number of times per day equal to your Warlock level.
    

Level 5 Spell: Sporeveil Revival

Mana Cost: 20  
Affinity: Memory, Decay  
Range: 60 ft (Single Target)  
Concentration: Yes (5 turns)  
Effect:

You restore a creature’s presence in the world, even if they are fading or gone. Choose one of the following effects:

- Target regains 30 Health and stands with fungal tendrils assisting their body.
    
- If target is dead (within 1 minute), they are restored as a dream-form: alive, functional, but partially illusory. They can act normally, but cannot leave your line of sight and vanish (die) after 5 turns.
    
- Target resists all Fear and Charm effects for the duration.
    

While the spell lasts, the target is surrounded by a faint aura of glowing spore motes.  
If they die again while dream-restored, their soul cannot be raised by any means for 4 hours.

Upcast: Increase healing (+15), or extend dream-form duration (+2 turns), per x2 Mana.

Level 10 Spell: Repeating Bloom

Mana Cost: 50  
Affinity: Fungal, Time, Decay  
Range: 60ft (30ft radius)  
Concentration: Yes (5 turns)  
Effect:

You force the land into cyclic decay and rebirth. All creatures in the area become trapped in a looping moment. At the start of each of their turns, roll a d6:

- 1-2: They repeat their last action (same target, spell, or attack).
    
- 3-4: Their body falters, taking 4d12 Poison damage as roots pierce their muscles.
    
- 5-6: Their body heals 3d10 HP as fungal regeneration overrides injury.
    

All fallen enemies in the area bloom with mushrooms, which provide half cover to allies and explode for 2d8 Poison damage when destroyed.

Upcast: Increase radius (+15ft), duration (+2 turns), per x2 Mana.

Level 20 Spell: The Dreamer Wakes

Mana Cost: 150  
Affinity: Memory, Ultimate Restoration  
Range: 120ft (Allies only, up to 2)  
Concentration: No  
Effect:

You awaken Mycelith’s full power for a moment, restoring all that was lost.

- All chosen allies regain full Health, Vitality and Mana.
    
- All curses, diseases, and conditions are removed.
    
- They gain 1 additional turn immediately, even interrupting enemy turns.
    
- Their next spell or attack automatically crits and cannot be resisted.
    

Side Effect: The target will permanently become half Mycelari. The target will have the following effects:

- Poison Immunity
    
- No longer needs drink or food but must spend time sitting in soil or begin to starve
    
- Can now communicate telepathically (up to 60 ft, any number of targets)
    
- Occasionally mushrooms grow out of you
    
- Your skin oozes a fine white slime instead of sweating 
    
- You are kind of gross now (-5 to charisma rolls other than intimidation)
    

Upcast: Heal additional creatures (+1), per x3 Mana.
