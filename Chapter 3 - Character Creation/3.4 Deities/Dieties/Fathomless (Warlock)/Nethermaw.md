Nethermaw, the abyssal force of endless consumption, grants spells that devour life, drain essence, and reshape reality through insatiable hunger.

- Domain: Hunger, Consumption
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Evil
    
- Symbol: A drooling fanged mouth
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Nethermaw are vessels of endless hunger, channeling a void that devours all, life, matter, and even memory. To form a pact with Nethermaw is to promise the world as a meal, trading spells that siphon vitality and erase existence for the privilege of being its living mouthpiece. These warlocks feed on foes, drain strength with every strike, and summon consuming voids that pull all things toward annihilation. Nethermaw rewards those who leave nothing behind, no bodies, no souls, no trace, only silence and gnawing emptiness. Service is simple: consume, destroy, and never let the hunger stop.
    

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Feed the Maw

Effect:  
Whenever a creature within 10 feet of you drops to 0 HP, you may, as a reaction, choose to feed its essence to Nethermaw. If you do, you regain either:

- 25 Mana, or
    
- 1d6+2 Vitality, or
    
- 1 additional Action Point (usable this turn)
    

You may use this feature once per Warlock level per day.

Conditions:

- The creature must die within range and line of sight.
    
- You must use your reaction to activate this ability.
    

Visual Flavor:  
When activated, your mouth briefly warps open unnaturally, and black tendrils of hunger lash out toward the dying creature, devouring its essence with a sickening crunch or slurp, this may optionally (GM’s discretion) allow you to make an Intimidation roll to other creatures nearby.
