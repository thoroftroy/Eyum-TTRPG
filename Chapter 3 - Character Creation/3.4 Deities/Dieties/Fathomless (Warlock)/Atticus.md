Atticus, the one who bears every blow, grants spells that defy death, absorb suffering, and drag the broken body onward when all others have fallen.

Domain: Endurance, Defiance, Martyrdom

Alignment: Lawful Neutral

Symbol: A cracked silver shield wrapped in barbed chains

Behavior: Warlocks of Atticus do not flee. They do not relent. They are the final breath held at the brink, the clenched teeth beneath ruin. To form a pact with Atticus is to endure the unbearable, and never break. He offers no vision, no whispers, no grand philosophy. He simply remains. His warlocks cannot be moved by fear, pain, or pleading. Many of them speak little, as if speech itself would cost too much. Their presence is unnatural in its persistence, as if they’ve already died and simply refused to accept it. Where others fall, Atticus stands, and he expects no less from those who invoke his unyielding name.

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Deathless Binding

Effect:  
You gain the Deathless condition:

- When you would drop to 0 Vitality, instead drop to 1 and gain 1 stack of Strain (max 3).
    
- Each stack of Strain reduces your maximum Mana by 10 and causes you to take double damage (This cannot make your mana go below 10).
    
- While you have 3 stacks, you cannot regain Vitality through any means other than Atticus’s spells.
    

You may remove 1 stack of Strain by finishing a long rest, or sacrificing 20 Mana as an action (This will remove the -mana penalty).  
Additionally, your maximum Vitality increases by 10 × your Warlock level, but your damage dealt by all spells and attacks is halved (rounded down, after modifiers), you also gain resistance to all non-magical damage.

Level 5 Spell: Relentless Anchor

Mana Cost: 20  
Affinity: Defiance, Tether  
Range: Self  
Concentration: Yes (5 turns)

Effect:  
You anchor yourself in defiance. For the duration:

- You cannot be moved or knocked prone, regardless of force or effect.
    
- All incoming damage is halved.
    
- You may intercept attacks targeting allies within 15ft (as a Reaction), redirecting them to yourself.
    
- If reduced to 0 Vitality while this is active, you instead stay at 1 Vitality and gain a new stack of Strain (beyond the 3-stack limit).
    

Upcast: Extend duration (+3 turns) or increase interception range (+5 ft) per x2 Mana.

Level 10 Spell: Martyr’s Pact

Mana Cost: 50  
Affinity: Healing, Transfer  
Range: 60ft  
Concentration: No

Effect:  
Choose up to 3 creatures within range. Transfer all of their conditions, debuffs, and damage to yourself.

- You take all effects immediately but reduce the damage taken by half.
    
- You may not die from this transfer. If it would reduce you below 1 Vitality/HP, you instead remain at 1 and gain a stack of Strain.
    
- The targets are healed for all missing Vitality and gain +1 AP on their next turn.
    

Upcast: Target additional allies (+3), reduce transferred damage further (half the halved damage for each upcast), or remove +1 Strain stack during casting per x2 Mana.

Level 20 Spell: Atticus’s Final Stand

Mana Cost: 100  
Affinity: Ultimate Defiance  
Range: 90ft (Self-centered aura, 60ft radius)  
Concentration: Yes (5 turns)

Effect:  
You become a living bastion.

- You are immune to death, unconsciousness, and forced movement.
    
- All allies within the aura gain +5 AC, +5 to saving throws, and immunity to fear, charm, and stun.
    
- When an ally in the aura drops below 50% Vitality, you may choose to absorb all incoming damage to them for 1 turn.
    
- If you fall to 0 HP during this spell, you instead unleash a massive pulse, restoring all allies to full Vitality and removing all conditions, then reviving yourself at half HP (this may only occur once).
    

Upcast: Extend duration (+1 turn), radius (+10ft), or number of pulse revives per x2 Mana.
