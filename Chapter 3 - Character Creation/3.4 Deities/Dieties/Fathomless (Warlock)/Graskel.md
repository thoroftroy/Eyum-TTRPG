Graskel, the hive without a queen, grants spells that link minds, summon echoes of the self, and overwhelm enemies through coordinated psionic dominance.

Domain: Telepathy, Unity, Summoning

Alignment: Lawful Neutral

Symbol: A branching network of pupil-less eyes

Behavior: Warlocks of Graskel do not speak, they echo. Upon forming a pact, the warlock’s thoughts become threads in a living tapestry of consciousness, linking them to minds across the realms. Graskel’s voice is not heard, it is felt, a presence in every decision, a whisper behind every doubt. His warlocks are vessels of mutual awareness, their dreams full of unfamiliar memories, their instincts no longer truly their own. As their bond deepens, so does their reach: allies begin to hear their thoughts, enemies tremble at the sense of being seen. To serve Graskel is to become one of many, and to grow stronger through surrendering the self.

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Echolink

Effect:  
You form a telepathic network that links yourself and up to Charisma modifier + Warlock level creatures within 60ft. While linked:

- You and all allies share mental communication (no language required).
    
- Any creature in the link may reroll one failed d20 roll per short rest.
    
- Once per turn, when an ally within the link succeeds on an attack or save, you may use your Reaction to grant yourself or another linked ally +2 to hit or saves until the end of your next turn.
    

The link lasts for 10 minutes and may be activated Warlock Level times per day.

Level 5 Spell: Mindspawn Conductor

Mana Cost: 20  
Affinity: Summoning, Thought  
Range: 60ft  
Concentration: Yes (5 turns)

Effect:  
You summon a Mindspawn Node, a floating orb of networked psionic light.

- The node grants +2 to all spellcasting rolls for linked allies within 30ft.
    
- Once per turn, the node may unleash a Psychic Lash (4d10 damage, Wisdom Save DC 15 or stunned for 1 turn).
    
- The node has HP equal to your Warlock level × 3 and can be dismissed as a free action.

Mana Cost: 50  
Affinity: Domination, Summoning  
Range: 60ft  
Concentration: Yes (5 turns)

Effect:  
Choose up to 3 humanoid or beast corpses or willing allies. You implant them with psionic parasites, converting them into Hivebound Echoes.

- Echoes are mentally linked to you and obey commands telepathically.
    
- They gain vitality equal to 5 × your Warlock level.
    
- When they die, they release a psychic burst (6d6 damage in 15ft, Wis Save DC 18).
    

Upcast: Raise more Echoes (+6) and extend duration (+5) per x2 Mana.

Range: 120ft radius  
Concentration: Yes (5 turns)

Effect:  
You temporarily elevate all minds in range into Graskel’s Hive.

- All creatures in range are pulled into a telepathic web, hostile creatures must pass a Charisma Save (DC 20) or become Incapacitated as their thoughts are overridden.
    
- Allies in range gain:
    

- +5 to all rolls
    
- Shared critical hits (when one crits, all crit on their next attack)
    

If maintained for the full duration, you may permanently convert 1 creature who failed the save into a Hivebound Thrall (GM’s discretion).

Upcast: Extend radius (+120 ft) or increase save DC (+5) per x2 Mana.
