Virmon, the silent lantern in the mist, grants spells that protect the broken, guide the lost, and strike down deception with purifying light.

Domain: Hope, Light, Guidance

Alignment: Lawful Good

Symbol: A lantern suspended in mist

Behavior: Warlocks who serve Virmon carry a spark of him inside their chest, a lantern-flame that glows softly in the presence of loss, pain, or despair. They do not dominate with fear or madness, they protect, mend, and illuminate. To serve Virmon is to walk beside the forgotten and guide the broken toward clarity. His power flows through moments of small kindness: a light shared, a lost path revealed, a hand offered. But Virmon is not passive, his light burns those who would mislead others into darkness. His servants may be gentle, but never weak; they stand when others fall, and glow brightest when all else fades.

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Lantern’s Whisper

Effect:  
Once per round, you may use a free action to invoke Virmon’s flame and gain a +1d4 bonus to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made that turn. This bonus must be declared after rolling but before knowing the result. It cannot override a natural 1 or guarantee a critical success. You may use this feature a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier + Warlock level.

Level 5 Spell: Beacon of Shelter

Mana Cost: 20  
Affinity: Light, Protection  
Range: 60ft (20ft aura)  
Concentration: Yes (5 turns)

Effect:  
You conjure a hovering lantern that emits a radiant sanctuary. Allies in range gain:

- +5 AC vs ranged attacks
    
- Resistance to psychic and necrotic damage
    
- +2 to all saving throws
    

Enemies who enter the aura must make a Wisdom Save (DC 15) or become frightened until they leave the aura.

Upcast: Extend aura (+10ft), increase AC bonus (+1), or add radiant damage (1d8) to all attacks made inside the aura per x2 Mana.

Level 10 Spell: Radiant Path

Mana Cost: 50  
Affinity: Movement, Light  
Range: 100ft (line or path)

Effect:  
You draw a blazing path of light through the air or across terrain.

- Allies moving along the path gain +30 ft movement and ignore terrain or hazards.
    
- Movement along the path is doubled.
    
- Enemies who attempt to block or cross the path must pass a Dexterity Save (DC 18) or take 6d10 Radiant damage and be knocked prone. (This only happens when the enemy willingly enters the path, they cannot be forced onto it and if the path is created on them they do not take the damage)
