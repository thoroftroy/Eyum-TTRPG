Anarchicorb, the ever-shifting force of randomness and mutation, grants spells that warp flesh, bend reality, and introduce absolute unpredictability.

- Domain: Chaos, Mutation
    
- Alignment: True Neutral
    
- Symbol: A swirling orb with a cracked eye
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Anarchicorb don’t just make a pact, they become his vessel. Upon accepting the bond, Anarchicorb fuses with a part of the warlock’s body, an eye, a limb, even an organ, transforming it into his living avatar. He does not issue commands or demand obedience; he simply wants to experience the world from within, to live a mortal life vicariously through his chosen host. Anarchicorb only ever takes one warlock at a time, merging fully with them and granting reality-warping powers fueled by mutation and entropy. He rewards bold choices, strange sensations, and anything that makes existence more vivid, because your life is now his.
