Voidweaver, the whispering horror from beyond reality, grants spells that unravel the mind, bend shadows, and instill cosmic madness.

- Domain: Shadows, Insanity
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Evil
    
- Symbol: A black void with red glowing eyes
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Voidweaver become conduits for eldritch whispers and unraveling thought. Their pact opens the mind to truths too vast and alien to bear, warping perception and bending reality with shadow-born madness. To serve Voidweaver is to walk the line between brilliance and breakdown, weaving fear, confusion, and oblivion into every spell. His warlocks often act erratically, laughing at silence, staring too long into darkness, or speaking in riddles not their own. Voidweaver rewards those who instill madness in others, erase identity, or obscure truth until nothing sane remains. In return, he offers power that turns the mind into a weapon and shadows into sanctuary.
    

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Whispers from the Void

Effect:  
At the start of your turn, you may allow the Voidweaver to guide you. If you do, choose one of the following effects to activate for that turn:

- Shadowslip: You may teleport up to 15 feet to any space you can see that is in dim light or darkness. This does not cost movement or an action.
    
- Mad Insight: Gain advantage on one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check or saving throw this turn.
    
- Fractured Reality: Force an enemy within 30 feet to roll their next d20 with triple disadvantage.
    

You may use this feature once per Warlock level per day.

Limitations:

- Only one effect may be used per turn regardless of warlock level.
    
- Fractured Reality requires line of sight.
