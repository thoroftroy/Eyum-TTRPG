Zoan, the laughing rot beneath the world, grants spells that infect, wither, and renew through beautiful corrosion and joyous decline.

Domain: Decay, Affliction, Renewal

Alignment: Neutral Good

Symbol: A wide-smiling mushroom sprouting from a pile of bones

Behavior: Zoan speaks warmly and smells of mulch. He is not death, but what comes after, softening, blooming, returning. He teaches warlocks to embrace endings as beginnings, to spread beautiful weakness, and to let go of what resists change. His presence lingers in quiet rot, in smiling corpses nourishing the roots, in the moment armor cracks and strength sours. His servants do not conquer, they compost. They smile. They laugh. And where they walk, blight grows bright. To serve Zoan is to break things just enough that life can seep through again.

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Blightkiss

Effect:  
When you deal spell damage to a creature, you may inflict Blightkiss, a stacking affliction that reduces a target’s effectiveness over time.

- A creature with Blightkiss suffers -1 to all attack rolls, saves, and damage rolls per stack (max -5).
    
- Each time you deal damage to a creature, it gains 1 stack (no save).
    
- Blightkiss lasts 2 turns per stack and decays by 1 per turn unless renewed.
    
- If a creature reaches 5 stacks, they become Fungally Compromised, gaining vulnerability to poison and necrotic, and their healing is halved for the duration.
    

You may have a number of Blightkissed creatures equal to your Charisma modifier + Warlock level at once.

You may also change your spells damage type to necrotic if the spell costs less than 5 * warlock level mana
