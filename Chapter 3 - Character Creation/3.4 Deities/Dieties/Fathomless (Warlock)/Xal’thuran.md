Xal’thuran, the forge of endless war, grants spells that empower warriors, manifest deadly armaments, and turn the battlefield into a storm of blades.

- Domain: Weapons, Combat
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Neutral
    
- Symbol: A greatsword splitting into two
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Xal’thuran do not wield him, they become his bearer. Upon forming a pact, Xal’thuran manifests as a weapon of the warlock’s choice, fusing with their soul and replacing a part of them, physically or spiritually. He consumes every weapon the warlock touches, absorbing their essence and granting access to their powers. His warlocks are living arsenals, shifting between blades, bows, or hammers as Xal’thuran grows more vast with each conquest. He demands nothing but the accumulation of weapons, rare, cursed, holy, or forgotten, and rewards those who never fight with the same blade twice. To serve him is to hunt relics, slay masters, and build the ultimate armory of destruction.
    

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Living Arsenal

Effect (Passive):  
Your spellcasting is fueled not by willpower, but by martial instinct. If Xal’thuran is your patron:

- You use Strength or Dexterity (your choice) as your spellcasting modifier, instead of Charisma.
    
- This choice may change each time you transform into a new weapon form.
    

Effect (Active):  
As a bonus action, you may cause Xal’thuran to manifest as a weapon, transforming part of your body or summoning a spectral construct. Choose any non-heavy melee or ranged weapon. That weapon becomes your active weapon form, and while in this form:

- You are considered proficient with the weapon.
    
- The weapon is magical and counts as a spellcasting focus.
    
- You may cast Warlock spells through the weapon, using it as the point of origin for spells.
    
- Melee forms deal +1d10 force damage on hit.
    
- Ranged forms gain +10 ft range and ignore half cover.
    

You may change your weapon form once per short rest. You may stay in weapon form indefinitely.

Effect (Consume Weapon):  
Once per Warlock level per day, when you touch or strike a weapon, you may consume it into Xal’thuran. If you do:

- You gain 10 Mana, and
    
- You immediately shift into that weapon's form (gaining its stats), ignoring the usual once-per-rest limit.
    
- While using this form, your attacks use the weapon’s original stats (damage, reach, properties), instead of the base 1d10 Force.
    

Note: Keep track of each weapon you consume and their stats to slowly build an arsenal that you can change between for different circumstances. 

Note 2: Xal’thuran’s original weapon (the one that deals 1d10 force damage) may still be chosen regardless of what is in your arsenal.
