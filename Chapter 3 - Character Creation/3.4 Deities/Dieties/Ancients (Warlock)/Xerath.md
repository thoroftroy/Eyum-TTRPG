Xerath, the enigmatic force that shapes divine power itself, grants spells that manipulate godhood, reshape reality, and impose absolute authority.

- Domain: Gods, Omnipotence
    
- Alignment: True Neutral
    
- Symbol: A radiant golden sigil floating above an empty throne
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Xerath wield the power of divine supremacy, at a price. He does not speak, does not demand, and does not explain; his presence is felt in absolute silence and overwhelming authority. Xerath grants his followers the means to suppress gods, strip away divinity, and reshape the very fabric of belief itself. To serve Xerath is to impose will upon reality without apology. His chosen are often cold, driven, and obsessed with control, using their power to dominate both mortals and immortals alike. Xerath rewards those who challenge the divine, who break pantheons, and who see no being as untouchable, not even the gods themselves.
