- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Godgifu become living conduits of divine force, chosen not for devotion but for potential. Her pacts grant overwhelming strength, radiant auras, and divine resilience, but only to those worthy of wielding such might.

Godgifu rewards those who inspire awe through presence alone, who carry the weight of godhood with unshakable will, and who transform their power into purpose.
    

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Divine Ascendance

Effect:  
Once per day, you may invoke Divine Ascendance, channeling a sliver of Godgifu’s raw omnipotence for a single turn. When activated (as a free action at the start of your turn), you enter a state of divine perfection for the remainder of that turn. During this time:

While Ascended (For 1 turn):

- You become immune to all damage, conditions, and forced movement.
    
- Your spells and attacks automatically hit, and enemies automatically fail saving throws against your Warlock abilities.
    
- All spells and attacks you deal are empowered with radiant force, dealing an additional 2d8 + your Warlock level radiant damage per hit or spell.
    
- You may choose to smite once this turn as a free action, this smite deals 5d10 + (5 × your Warlock level) radiant force damage.
    

After Ascendance Ends:

- You are immediately Reduced to 0 Vitality and suffer Exhaustion Level 4.
    
- You cannot regain Vitality or cast spells until you complete a long rest.
