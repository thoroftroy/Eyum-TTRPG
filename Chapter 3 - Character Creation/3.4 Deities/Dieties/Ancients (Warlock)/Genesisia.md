Genesisia, the eternal keeper of time, grants spells that alter the flow of reality, rewind fate, and bring forth timeless power.

- Domain: Time, Eternity
    
- Alignment: True Neutral
    
- Symbol: A clock with a butterfly inside
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Genesisia walk the edge of time’s blade, wielding powers that slow, hasten, or rewind the flow of fate itself. A pact with Genesisia comes at a cost, while you may alter destiny, your body grows frail under the weight of eternity. She offers no guidance and asks no service, for she exists beyond mortal goals. To serve Genesisia is to become an instrument of time: restoring moments lost, seizing the present, or freezing entire worlds in a single breath. She blesses those who use time not for ambition, but for precision, those who understand that even the smallest second can decide the fate of all things.
    

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Temporal Slip

Effect:  
Once per round, when you are targeted by an attack, spell, or harmful effect, you may use your reaction to momentarily displace yourself in time. When you do, roll 1d4 to determine the temporal outcome:

1. Precognitive Dodge: You gain +5 to AC or advantage on a saving throw against the triggering effect.
    
2. Timeline Twist: You may redirect the target of a single attack, spell, or harmful effect that is currently aimed at you to instead target another creature within range (including allies or enemies). You still take the original effect as well, this simply causes it to hit someone else too.
    

- Example: If you're hit with Firebolt, it now arcs and strikes both you and another nearby creature.
    
- If the effect only allows one target, both receive full impact unless the spell/effect has built-in split rules.
    

4. Time Distortion: Move 10 feet instantly in any direction. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks and ignores terrain, this causes the attack to miss if you move out of its range.
    
5. Echo Cast: If you cast a spell on your following turn, you may immediately cast it again, without additional mana cost or Action Points, targeting the same or a different target.
    

- This echo must occur on the same turn as the original spell and must be the exact same spell.
    

You may use this feature once per Warlock level per day.
