Godric, the celestial wanderer of the infinite void, grants spells that warp space, summon cosmic forces, and alter the fabric of reality.

- Domain: Space, Stars
    
- Alignment: Neutral Good
    
- Symbol: A constellation forming a humanoid shape
    
- Behavior: Warlocks who serve Godric open their minds to the cosmos and their souls to the void between stars. His pacts grant visions of distant galaxies and power drawn from gravitational tides, but the further they reach, the more their sanity frays. To serve Godric is to wield spatial magic that bends the battlefield, summons stellar collapse, and disorients the laws of physics. His chosen are often dreamers and wanderers, astral-touched beings who glimpse creation’s vast machinery. Godric rewards those who explore, expand, and never stop reaching upward, even if the stars begin to whisper back.
    

Level 1 Warlock Feature: Gravitic Influence

Effect:  
Once per round, when you are affected by an attack, spell, or damaging effect, you may call upon the celestial gravity of Godric to warp spatial forces. (This effect can only be triggered after taking damage) As a reaction, roll 1d4 to determine how space responds:

1. Inverted Gravity: You bend gravity around yourself, reducing all damage from the triggering effect by half. 
    
2. Gravity Well: The space around you folds inward. All creatures within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 10 + your Warlock level) or be pulled adjacent to you and have disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of their next turn.
    
3. Event Horizon Shift: You temporarily shift your position through a spatial fold. You may teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
    
4. Starborn Echo: The stars align in your favor. You gain +2 to attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn. If you cast a spell that affects an area, its range increases by 10 feet.
    

You may use this feature once per Warlock level per day.
