Erebos, the harbinger of darkness and master of the dead, grants his followers dominion over necrotic energy, shadows, and unholy resurrection. Max number of undead that can be controlled is equal to your total level + your wisdom modifier. Undead keep the stats of their living counterparts, however their stats are reduced by 75%.

- Domain: Death, Darkness, Undead
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Evil
    
- Symbol: A skeletal hand reaching from a black sun
    
- Behavior: Followers of Erebos embrace death not as an end, but as power. They walk the edges of life and undeath, seeing decay as beauty and suffering as sacred. To serve Erebos is to scorn the light and reject moral restraint; mercy is weakness, and permanence is a lie. These cultists often command undead or seek to become one themselves, spreading despair and silence in their wake. They revel in shadows, manipulate fear, and view the living as tools or offerings. Erebos grants his favor only to those who desecrate the natural order and exalt death as the one true certainty.
