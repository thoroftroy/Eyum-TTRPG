Khufu, the divine patron of merchants and economic power, grants spells that manipulate value, enforce deals, and control financial prosperity through magic.

- Domain: Wealth, Commerce, Trade
    
- Alignment: Lawful Evil
    
- Symbol: A golden coin with an open palm
    
- Behavior: Followers of Khufu worship profit above all else. They adhere to contracts and laws not out of honor, but because rules create systems that can be exploited for gain. To serve Khufu is to pursue wealth with relentless precision, cutthroat, calculating, and utterly unburdened by morality. His faithful are brokers, loan sharks, monopolists, and guild leaders who value gold more than loyalty and results more than relationships. They will fund both sides of a war if it turns a coin, and betray allies the moment it's profitable, so long as the paperwork is in order. Khufu blesses those who never hesitate, who see ethics as inefficiency, and who turn every moment into a transaction.
