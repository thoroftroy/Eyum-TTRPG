Othmar, the master of deception and the unseen hand behind every lie, grants spells that manipulate, confuse, and twist reality to suit the trickster's needs.

- Domain: Deceit, Illusions, Trickery
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Evil
    
- Symbol: A hand with crossed fingers
    
- Behavior: Followers of Othmar are masters of deception, viewing truth as a tool, useful when convenient, disposable when not. They thrive on manipulation, chaos, and the subtle thrill of a well-placed lie. To serve Othmar is to rewrite reality with words alone, to confuse, mislead, and control through cleverness rather than force. His faithful are con artists, spies, illusionists, and traitors, those who smile as they twist the knife. They take pride in being underestimated, delight in exposing hypocrisy, and see honesty as the final mask. Othmar grants his blessing to those who sow doubt, escape blame, and reshape the world with a whisper and a grin.
