Thalassos wields the deep’s untamed power, controlling tides, summoning crushing waves, and freezing foes with absolute cold.

- Domain: Water, Cold, Oceans
    
- Alignment: Lawful Neutral
    
- Symbol: A cresting wave with a trident
    
- Behavior: Followers of Thalassos revere the vast, indifferent power of the sea. They value balance, patience, and inevitability, understanding that like the tides, all things rise and fall in time. Calm in demeanor but implacable in purpose, they act with precision and emotional restraint, favoring discipline over impulse. To worship Thalassos is to accept the cold truth of nature: mercy is rare, but justice is constant. His faithful often serve as sailors, judges, or scholars of the deep, upholding law and order like the ceaseless pull of the tide. He blesses those who move with clarity and sweep away chaos with quiet, relentless force.
