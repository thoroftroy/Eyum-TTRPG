Pyraxis embodies the dual nature of fire, both the power to destroy and the potential to forge something new from the ashes.

- Domain: Fire, Destruction, Rebirth
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Neutral
    
- Symbol: A burning sword crossed with an arrow
    
- Behavior: Followers of Pyraxis are drawn to the flame, both its beauty and its devastation. They see destruction not as evil, but as necessary; a purifying blaze that clears the old to make way for the new. To serve Pyraxis is to embrace chaos as a force of transformation. His worshipers are wild, passionate, and unafraid to burn away what no longer serves them or the world. Whether lighting cities or lighting the way forward, they act with fierce conviction and leave nothing unchanged. Pyraxis blesses those who ignite change, who welcome ruin, and who rise again from the ashes stronger than before.
