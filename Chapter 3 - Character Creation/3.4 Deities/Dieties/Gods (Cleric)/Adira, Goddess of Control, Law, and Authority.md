Adira, the divine enforcer of law and dominion, grants spells that impose absolute order, command obedience, and strip away the chaos of rebellion.

- Domain: Control, Law, Authority
    
- Alignment: Lawful Evil
    
- Symbol: A gavel with broken chains
    
- Behavior: Followers of Adira are enforcers of dominance cloaked in law. They believe order is supreme and that free will is a threat to stability. To serve Adira is to bend others to your will, not through chaos, but through structure, decree, and unbreakable authority. Her faithful are tyrants, judges, inquisitors, and commanders who impose obedience with exacting clarity. They exploit systems to control, command, and subjugate, convinced that peace is only possible when dissent is silenced. Adira blesses those who rule with an iron will, who crush rebellion with divine precision, and who believe that justice is whatever they declare it to be.
