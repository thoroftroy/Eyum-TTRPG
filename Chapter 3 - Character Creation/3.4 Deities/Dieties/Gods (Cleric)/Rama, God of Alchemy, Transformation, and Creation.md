Rama, the divine master of transmutation and discovery, grants spells that alter matter, forge new forms, and unlock the potential of creation.

- Domain: Alchemy, Transformation, Creation
    
- Alignment: Neutral Good
    
- Symbol: A bubbling flask
    
- Behavior: Followers of Rama are visionary crafters and seekers of hidden potential. They see the world not as it is, but as it could become, with enough insight, courage, and change. To serve Rama is to embrace transformation: to break boundaries, dissolve limits, and reshape matter and self alike. His faithful are alchemists, inventors, and philosophers who blend science and wonder, guided by curiosity and a quiet reverence for creation. They are not content with what exists, they dream of what could be. Rama blesses those who transmute failure into progress, who create where others destroy, and who see every obstacle as an opportunity to evolve.
