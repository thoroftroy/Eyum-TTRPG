Xeno, the divine master of glyphs and ancient sigils, grants spells that empower inscriptions, weave protective magic, and invoke devastating arcane runes.

- Domain: Runes, Symbols, Power
    
- Alignment: True Neutral 
    
- Symbol: A glowing rune stone
    
- Behavior: Followers of Xeno see reality as a script, one that can be rewritten with the right symbols and knowledge. They pursue the mastery of runes and divine glyphs, believing that true power lies not in brute force, but in precise control over the world’s hidden structures. To serve Xeno is to be deliberate, to carve meaning into matter, and to command magic through order and form. His faithful are meticulous, enigmatic, and often silent, inscribing truths that reshape existence itself. Xeno blesses those who seek power through understanding, who reforge the world one symbol at a time, and who recognize that every rune is a promise etched into reality.
