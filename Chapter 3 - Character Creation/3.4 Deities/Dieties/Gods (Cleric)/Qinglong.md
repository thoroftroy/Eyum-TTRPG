- Domain: Magic, Arcane Knowledge
    
- Alignment: Lawful Neutral
    
- Symbol: A swirling arcane sigil
    
- Behavior: Followers of Qinglong are disciplined seekers of arcane truth. They approach magic as both science and art, studying its patterns, perfecting its form, and using it to reveal the hidden mechanics of the cosmos. To serve Qinglong is to pursue mastery, not through emotion or impulse, but through structure, study, and control. His faithful often act as scholars, spellwrights, or magical engineers, devoting their lives to uncovering new spells, refining old ones, and documenting arcane law. Qinglong blesses those who wield magic with intention, who value wisdom above ambition, and who expand the boundaries of what is known without breaking the order of the world.
