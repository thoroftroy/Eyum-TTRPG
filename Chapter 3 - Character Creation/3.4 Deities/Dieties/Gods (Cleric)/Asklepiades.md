Asklepiades, the divine forge master, grants magic that strengthens weapons, constructs mighty creations, and manipulates metal itself.

- Domain: Metal, Smithing, Industry
    
- Alignment: Lawful Neutral
    
- Symbol: A forge hammer on an anvil
    
- Behavior: Followers of Asklepiades are tireless builders and master crafters who believe that purpose is forged through labor. They see metal as sacred, a material of discipline, permanence, and potential. To serve Asklepiades is to dedicate oneself to creation through precision and grit. His faithful are smiths, engineers, and artisans who value structure, craftsmanship, and the quiet power of industry. They toil without complaint, shaping tools, weapons, and constructs that outlast the hands that made them. Asklepiades blesses those who honor the forge, who refine both material and self, and who turn raw ore into legacy.
