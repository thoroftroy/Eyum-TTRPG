Willow, the unseen whisper in the dark, grants spells that conceal, deceive, and manipulate reality itself.

- Domain: Shadows, Secrets, Illusions
    
- Alignment: Neutral Evil
    
- Symbol: A pair of violet eyes in darkness
    
- Behavior: Followers of Willow dwell in silence and secrecy, valuing deception over brute strength and subtlety over spectacle. They believe truth is a weapon best left hidden, and that power lies not in being seen, but in being remembered only as a whisper. To serve Willow is to manipulate, observe, and strike only when advantage is absolute. Her faithful thrive in darkness both literal and metaphorical, shaping illusions, stealing secrets, and unraveling trust. They see morality as a veil to be pulled aside, not worn. Willow grants her favor to those who vanish before the blade hits the floor, who wear many masks, and who leave no trace but doubt.
