God, the supreme arbiter of justice and divine equilibrium, grants spells that enforce absolute fairness, impose celestial order, and enact final judgment.

- Domain: Law, Balance, Judgment
    
- Alignment: Lawful Neutral
    
- Symbol: A perfectly balanced scale
    
- Behavior: Followers of God uphold the cosmic order with unwavering resolve. They see morality not in terms of good or evil, but through the lens of fairness, structure, and unbreakable law. To serve God is to cast aside personal bias and become a vessel of impartial justice. His faithful are arbiters, inquisitors, and keepers of balance, those who weigh every action with divine precision and pass judgment without passion. They act only when the scales demand it, yet their word is final when they do. God blesses those who enforce law with clarity, restore balance where chaos festers, and judge rightly, even if the truth cuts deep.
