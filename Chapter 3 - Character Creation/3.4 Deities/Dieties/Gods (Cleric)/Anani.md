Anani, the divine patron of festivities and joy, grants magic that uplifts spirits, inspires rhythm-infused power, and turns battlefields into wild celebrations.
- Domain: Music, Parties, Revelry
- Alignment: Chaotic Neutral
- Symbol: A lute with swirling ribbons
- Behavior: Followers of Anani live for joy, chaos, and the rhythm that binds all life together. They dance through battle and peace alike, turning conflict into celebration and sorrow into song. To serve Anani is to embrace the moment, to uplift others with music, to lose oneself in revelry, and to find truth not in silence or stillness, but in laughter and wild expression. His faithful are bards, performers, and joyful anarchists who use magic to enchant, inspire, and confuse. Anani blesses those who stir hearts, break rules with flair, and turn the world into a stage where every act burns bright before fading into memory.
