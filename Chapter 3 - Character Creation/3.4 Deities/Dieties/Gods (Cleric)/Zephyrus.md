Zephyrus, the master of winds and tempests, grants his followers the power to bend storms, strike with the fury of the skies, and move as fast as the wind itself.

- Domain: Air, Storms, Weather
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Good
    
- Symbol: A gust of wind forming an eagle
    
- Behavior: Followers of Zephyrus are free-spirited and bold, driven by a love of motion, change, and the thrill of the storm. They believe justice must be swift, like a lightning strike, and that freedom is the birthright of all. To serve Zephyrus is to resist stagnation, defy oppression, and embrace the unpredictability of life. His faithful often act as messengers, scouts, or rebels, appearing suddenly and striking decisively before vanishing like the wind. They value quick thinking, sharp instincts, and the courage to act when others hesitate. Zephyrus blesses those who move swiftly, speak truth without fear, and stir the skies with righteous purpose.
