Caesar, the divine patron of indulgence and extravagant excess, grants spells that enhance pleasure, manipulate appetites, and turn revelry into power.

- Domain: Feasting, Excess, Indulgence
    
- Alignment: Chaotic Neutral
    
- Symbol: A golden goblet overflowing
    
- Behavior: Followers of Caesar revel in excess, treating indulgence not as vice, but as virtue. They live for the feast, the wine, the thrill of unrestrained pleasure. To serve Caesar is to cast off shame, to drown discipline in delight, and to turn every gathering into a celebration of self. His faithful are gourmands, pleasure-seekers, and revelers who enchant with charm and overwhelm with charisma. They see restraint as a sickness and joy as sacred. Caesar blesses those who eat too much, drink too deeply, and dance until the world blurs, so long as they do it loudly, lavishly, and without apology.
