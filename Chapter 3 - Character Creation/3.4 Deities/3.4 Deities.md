Below is a list of deities and patrons available for Clerics and Warlocks to follow. These beings grant power to their followers in exchange for devotion, service, or sacrifice.
If you don’t find a deity or patron that fits your character concept, you are encouraged to work with the Game Master to homebrew a new one.
##### Divine Gifts & Pact Benefits
- The bonuses granted by a deity or patron are determined by the Game Master.
- In most cases, these benefits scale as you level up, reflecting your deepening bond with your chosen god or patron.
##### Breaking an Oath or Pact
Clerics and Warlocks draw their power from an external being, a god or patron. If you act in a way that clearly goes against the beliefs or expectations of that being, you may lose your powers.
This is always up to the Game Master (GM), but the punishment should fit the severity of the betrayal.

How It Works
- Clerics serve gods, who tend to be more flexible but also more judgmental. They care about long-term devotion and alignment with their values.
- Warlocks serve patrons, who tend to be more transactional. If you break your deal, you lose your powers, simple as that.

For example, if your Warlock pact says you must kill one person per year and you fail to do so, your powers are revoked until you fulfill your end of the deal or renegotiate.

Gods are more nuanced. The GM will interpret how your god would react based on:
- The god’s alignment and domain
- Their described behavior
- How often and how severely you've acted against their will

If you worship Erebos (god of death and undeath) and spend all your time healing people and preserving life, he’s going to be unhappy. He might tolerate it if you have a justification (like healing so you can kill more later), but if your actions directly oppose his ideals, you’ll lose access to your divine magic.

You Will Always Be Warned First

Deities and patrons will not cut you off without warning. You will typically receive one or more warnings while communing with them, visions, omens, dreams, or direct messages. If you ignore these warnings, you’ll lose access to your powers until you:
- Complete a quest to redeem yourself,
- Make an offering or sacrifice, or
- Find a new patron or god who aligns better with your goals.

Breaking a pact or oath should always be a story moment, not just a mechanical punishment.
##### Communicating with Your Patron
- Clerics and Warlocks may attempt to contact their patron at any time.
- The response (if any) is up to the GM, and may depend on the character’s devotion or the deity’s whims.
##### Ascending to Godhood
- Once a player ascends to deity status, their Cleric and Warlock levels become permanent and no longer rely on their former patron.
- They are now a fully independent divine entity, free to grant power to others, should they wish.
##### Deity Specific Spells
Each Deity grants three powerful spells, unlocked at levels 5, 10, and 20 of either the Cleric or Warlock class. These spells are unique to the deity and reflect their domain and will.

To cast one of these deity-specific spells, you must commune with the deity and receive explicit permission, every single time you use the spell. A deity will only grant permission if your intended use directly aligns with their goals, values, or desires.

If the deity disapproves (GM’s discretion), the spell fails completely, regardless of cost or preparation.
##### Types of Deities
###### Celestials 
(Gods of Faith and Power) - For Clerics
Celestials were once mortals who ascended to divinity. Their strength is directly tied to the number and devotion of their followers. They grant divine magic and blessings to those who uphold their tenets.
