Chase sequences are fast-paced, escalating encounters where one party attempts to flee and the other pursues across dynamic environments. Unlike standard combat, chases emphasize movement, terrain, hazards, and time pressure. This section provides tools for running cinematic chases across rooftops, city streets, wilderness, or collapsing ruins.

Initiating a Chase

A chase begins when one creature or group attempts to escape another and gains at least 30 feet of initial lead (or at GM discretion). Initiative may still be used, but turn order can be simplified into Chaser vs Runner rounds when abstracting movement.

Each turn, characters make choices: Dash, Hide, Create an Obstacle, Shortcut, or Engage.

Core Chase Actions

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Action|Description|
|Dash|Move at full speed using both AP. Required to maintain or close distance.|
|Hide|Attempt to break line of sight. Requires appropriate terrain and Stealth.|
|Create Obstacle|Use the environment (knock over crates, collapse bridge, etc.)|
|Shortcut|Attempt a high-risk maneuver to gain ground (jump a gap, cut through alley)|
|Engage|Stop and fight (may delay chasers or stall runners)|

Distance Tracking (Abstract Mode)

Use a 10-point distance scale to track lead:

- 0: Caught
    
- 1-3: Close
    
- 4-7: Moderate
    
- 8-9: Distant
    
- 10: Escaped
    

Each round, the lead shifts based on actions, hazards, and rolls.

- If Runners reach 10, they escape.
    
- If Chasers reach 0, they catch the target.
    
- Chases end early if the environment blocks passage or one side gives up.
    

Complications (1d12 Table)

Each round, roll for complications or hazards. These require ability checks or impose delays.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Roll|Complication Example|Check Type|
|1|Loose debris causes slipping|Dexterity (DC 13)|
|2|Crowd of people blocks the way|Strength (Push)|
|3|Narrow alley or gap requires squeezing|Acrobatics|
|4|Low-hanging sign/tree branch|Reflex Save|
|5|Spooked animal or civilian interference|Animal Handling|
|6|Sudden incline or muddy slope|Athletics|
|7|Hanging laundry/cloth tangles vision|Dexterity Save|
|8|Disguised trap or tripwire|Spot|
|9|Slippery or wet surface|Acrobatics|
|10|Crumbling rooftop or surface|Reflex Save|
|11|Split path (choose faster or safer route)|N/A|
|12|No complication this round|,|

Terrain Tags

To help define environments, the GM can assign terrain tags:

- Urban: Tight corners, crowds, rooftops
    
- Wilderness: Trees, unstable footing, animals
    
- Dungeon: Traps, narrow halls, locked doors
    
- Sky/Water: Flight paths, updrafts, currents
    

Each terrain may affect which complications are common or what shortcuts exist.

Ending a Chase

A chase ends when:

- The target is caught or escapes.
    
- The terrain becomes impassable.
    
- One side gives up, surrenders, or is incapacitated.
    
- A successful Hide action (followed by a failed Spot check) causes the runner to disappear.
