Exploration and travel can sometimes feel slow or aimless, so it's important to keep things engaging. Introduce random encounters, hidden treasures, or environmental challenges to maintain interest. When players travel long distances, have them manage resources like food and rations, adding a survival element to their journey. Donâ€™t forget to sprinkle in unexpected events or encounters to keep them on their toes.
