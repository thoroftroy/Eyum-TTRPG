Game.md","title":"1.1 Welcome to the Game","links":["Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1-Basic-Mechanics"],"tags":[],"content":"The World of Eyum is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) inspired by Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e, rebuilt for long-term scalability and a consistent, integrated magic system. That can sound complex, but at its heart this is a game you play with friends to tell memorable stories together. Eyum is designed for campaigns that grow with you: begin as a farmhand, thief, or soldier and, through many sessions, rise toward demigod-level challenges. This handbook assumes no prior experience and walks you step-by-step through play and progression.\nWhat this game is (and isn’t)\nA TTRPG is a collaborative storytelling game. Players each control a unique character; a Narrator or Game Master (GM) presents the world, portrays its inhabitants, and adjudicates outcomes. There’s no single “win” screen: some tables play short one-shots, others play long campaigns with evolving arcs; your goal is to complete your story and enjoy the journey.\nComplexity, explained\nEyum is beginner-accessible, but not simple. You can learn as you go, but playing well, especially when building advanced characters or running the game, requires reading and understanding the rules. Expect depth; the system was built to scale without collapsing under “infinite power creep.”\nDesign philosophy\nEyum favors fantasy experience over realism. Roleplay is central, and power fantasy is embraced, but so is opposition. As you grow stronger, so will your challenges; if everything is “overpowered,” nothing truly is. The rules aim to maintain escalation with a sense of balance.\nRulings and disagreements\nNo rulebook can cover every situation. When ambiguity arises, the GM’s ruling is final, groups may bend or ignore rules with GM support, but rules-lawyering to exploit wording is discouraged. The priority is collaborative fun, not loopholes.\nYour first steps\nIf you read only one rules chapter before session one, make it Section 2: Core Rules (2.1 Basic Mechanics); it provides the essential mechanics for understanding play. You don’t need to memorize everything, just learn the flow (roll, add modifiers, interpret results) and reference specifics during play. For tone and expectations, many groups hold a Session Zero to align on themes, technology level, and character fit (group or individual prologues are both valid). Starting on the same page ensures a stronger first session."},"Chapter-1---Introduction/1.2-What-is-a-TTRPG":{"slug":"Chapter-1---Introduction/1.2-What-is-a-TTRPG","filePath":"Chapter 1 - Introduction/1.2 What is a TTRPG.md","title":"1.2 What is a TTRPG","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A TTRPG is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game. You can play it around a physical table or virtually with friends. Each player controls a unique character recorded on a character sheet (your stats, abilities, items, and options). One person, called the Narrator or Game Master (GM), presents the world, portrays non-player characters (NPCs), and adjudicates outcomes so the story keeps moving. Together, you roleplay your characters, make choices, and collaborate (sometimes compete) to shape a shared narrative.\nWho does what at the table\n\nThe GM runs the game: describes the world, controls NPCs and enemies, and decides outcomes.\nThe players each control a single PC (player character), deciding what that character says, does, and feels within the GM’s scenes.\n\nWhat play actually looks like\nPlay unfolds in scenes. A typical moment goes like this: the GM describes a scene; players react by saying what they do; if the action is risky or uncertain, the GM calls for a roll (often a d20) and compares your total to a Difficulty Class (DC) to determine success or failure, then narrates the outcome.\nCombat as structured play\nWhen a fight breaks out, Eyum uses turn-based structure: roll initiative to set order, take your turn (move, action, bonus action, free actions), and sometimes use reactions outside your turn. The GM controls enemies.\n“How do you win?”\nYou don’t “win” Eyum the way you win a board game or video game. You might play a one-shot that begins and ends in a single session, or a campaign that unfolds over many sessions with an overarching plot. The goal is to complete your story, save a town, topple a villain, or just survive, not to reach a final score or victory screen."},"Chapter-1---Introduction/1.3-How-to-Use-This-Handbook":{"slug":"Chapter-1---Introduction/1.3-How-to-Use-This-Handbook","filePath":"Chapter 1 - Introduction/1.3 How to Use This Handbook.md","title":"1.3 How to Use This Handbook","links":["Chapter-9---Appendices/9.1-Glossary-of-Terms","Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1-Basic-Mechanics","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.1-Step-by-Step-Character-Creation/3.1-Step-by-Step-Character-Creation"],"tags":[],"content":"Not every section of this book will apply to you right now, and that’s okay. Use the Table of Contents to jump straight to the parts you need and avoid overload. Some sections are marked with a ★; those are for Game Masters. Players can safely skip ★ sections unless your GM asks otherwise. Other sections serve both audiences; even rules mostly used by the GM can be helpful for players to understand.\nIf terms are unfamiliar, check the Glossary in 9.1 Glossary of Terms. Not everything will click immediately, sometimes you need to keep reading to see how pieces fit together.\nNew players (start here)\n\nChapter 2 - Core Rules. (2.1 Basic Mechanics) Learn the flow you’ll use every session (basic mechanics, actions, turn order, health/vitality, conditions, damage types, actually playing).\nChapter 3 - Character Creation (3.1 Step-by-Step Character Creation) Follow it the first time you build a character; you can tweak later with GM approval.\n\nReading tips that speed play\n\nYou don’t need to learn everything at once. Focus on your character and immediate mechanics; learn the rest through play.\nThe GM is your guide and referee; they describe how the world reacts and keep the game moving.\nBring the basics each session (character sheet, dice or dice app, pencil/notes, and, if used, mini or token).\n\nHow to Read Dice Notation\nThroughout this book you’ll see terms like 1d6, 2d20, or “roll a d20.” This shorthand tells you what dice to roll and how many: the number before the “d” is how many dice; the number after the “d” is the number of sides. Examples: 1d4 (one 4-sided), 2d6 (two 6-sided), 1d20 + 2d12 (roll and add them all together). You’ll use different dice for different actions, spells, or effects; this guide will always tell you which dice to roll when."},"Chapter-1---Introduction/1.4*-The-World-of-(Your-Setting)":{"slug":"Chapter-1---Introduction/1.4*-The-World-of-(Your-Setting)","filePath":"Chapter 1 - Introduction/1.4* The World of (Your Setting).md","title":"1.4* The World of (Your Setting)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"As the Game Master, you are the storyteller and the architect of the world; Eyum is a flexible framework you can shape to your table. That said, the world exists for the players, not the other way around. If you want full control, write a novel. A TTRPG is collaborative: prioritize your players’ enjoyment (and your own); the best games happen when everyone at the table is having fun.\nBefore your campaign begins, run a Session Zero: a pre-game meeting to align expectations, build characters, and most importantly, agree on tone and themes.\nWhy Tone Matters\nTone frames every decision. Mixing a cheerful, whimsical character into a bleak, post-apocalyptic game can work only if everyone is intentionally on that wavelength. Consistency keeps the table on the same story.\nWorld Tone and Technology Level\nEyum defaults to medieval fantasy, but the system is flexible. You can homebrew steampunk, cosmic horror, or post-apocalyptic biopunk, just make sure players know what experience they’re signing up for. The most important thing is that everyone’s telling the same kind of story."},"Chapter-1---Introduction/1.5*-Session-Zero":{"slug":"Chapter-1---Introduction/1.5*-Session-Zero","filePath":"Chapter 1 - Introduction/1.5* Session Zero.md","title":"1.5* Session Zero","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"You can run Session Zero as a group meeting (everyone together) and/or individual meetings (private character builds, backstory hooks, short prologues). Many GMs do both. The goal is that by Session One, everyone is immersed, prepared, and aligned. It is imperative that a session zero is run in order for a long running campaign to function correctly.\nUse this agenda to cover what Eyum expects you to decide up front:\n\n\n**Tone &amp; Themes\n\nState the campaign’s intended tone (e.g., grim survival, heroic myth, political thriller) and the kind of themes you’ll explore (combat challenge, exploration, moral dilemmas, character-driven arcs).\nAsk players what they want to experience; look for overlap. You’re not dictating tone, you’re aligning the table around a shared experience.\n\n\n\nLevel Range, Power Curve, Progression, and Lethality\n\nDecide starting level, how fast characters advance (milestone or XP), and how deadly the game is intended to feel.\nEnsure that the players are made somewhat aware of how dangerous the campaign will be. If the characters are being thrown into a grim-dark survival at level 1 and never really level up but wanted a power fantasy, they won’t be very happy.\n\n\n\nHomebrew &amp; Rule Modifications (what’s allowed)\n\nClarify allowances for homebrew rules.\nYou don’t have to allow anything you’re not comfortable with; enforce consistency and fairness.\nRemember, you always have the final say, no homebrew is allowed without you explicitly giving permission.\n\n\n\nPvP &amp; Intra-Party Conflict Policy\n\nDecide whether PC-vs-PC combat or betrayal arcs are on the table. Some groups enjoy high-drama tension; others want strict cooperation. Align limits and handling before play begins.\n\n\n\nTable Safety, Boundaries, and Pacing\n\nFlag any heavy content that might appear (e.g., torture, grief, sexual content) so players can opt out or set limits.\nAgree on session length, frequency, and what happens when someone can’t attend. Consistency helps everyone stay invested.\n\n\n\nCharacter Integration (why the party exists)\n\nEstablish how the PCs know (or will come to know) each other. Encourage shared backstory elements (overlapping goals, linked hometowns, mutual enemies) so the party has momentum from scene one.\nAvoid introducing total strangers with no glue, unless that’s an intentional part of the design, as that makes it difficult to play the game.\n\n\n\nPlayer Preferences (optional but recommended)\n\nAsk a few quick questions to tune content:\n“What scenes do you hope to see?”\n“Do you prefer roleplay, combat, or problem-solving?”\n“What instantly makes a session more fun for you?”\nUse answers to guide prep so everyone gets regular moments tailored to their interests.\n\n\n\nSet Clear Expectations (close the loop)\n\nSummarize decisions so the table leaves with the same understanding of tone, rules, and realism. This is a GM best-practice the Handbook calls out explicitly for Session Zero.\n\n\n\nBottom line: A good Session Zero is foundational, it prevents confusion, discourages bad-faith play, and builds trust. Don’t skip it; don’t rush it. This is how you turn a pile of character sheets into a real adventuring party."},"Chapter-10---Optional-Rules/Carrying-Capacity":{"slug":"Chapter-10---Optional-Rules/Carrying-Capacity","filePath":"Chapter 10 - Optional Rules/Carrying Capacity.md","title":"Carrying Capacity","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"By default, The World of Eyum does not enforce strict carrying limits, players are generally free to manage their inventory without tracking weight.

Within each chest burns a compact alchemical furnace, its steady heat powering their every motion. Their movements release faint hisses of steam or curls of smoke, and their voices carry the metallic resonance of vibrating chambers. Joints are reinforced with visible springs and rods, and their eyes glow with the steady light of internal ember-lamps. Fuel lines and maintenance hatches are built seamlessly into their frames, and their bodies smell faintly of oil and scorched metal. Though they may decorate themselves with etchings, rivet-work, and custom plating, their design is always functional first.\nCulture: Smogborn were first created by ancient alchemists and runemasters seeking to fuse mechanical endurance with adaptive intelligence. Over centuries, they developed self-replication and repair, allowing them to grow as a people even without their original makers. Smogborn communities are often centered around shared forges and fuel stores, and trade heavily in metals, coal, and rare combustible materials. They see themselves as living engines of progress, valuing construction, industry, and tangible achievement. The act of maintaining one’s own body is seen as both a duty and an art form, with many Smogborn personalizing their plating or gearwork as a reflection of skill. Magic is viewed with suspicion, as it tends to interfere with their inner workings. Outsiders often find their constant smoke and scent of burning fuel oppressive, but among themselves, these are signs of vitality and health.\nOther: Base AC is 17 + Dexterity modifier when unarmored. Disadvantage on all spell attack rolls and -2 to spell save DC. Immune to poison and disease. Must consume at least one pound of burnable fuel (wood, coal, oil, etc.) per day or gain one level of exhaustion. Can repair during a short or long rest by consuming 1 gp worth of raw metal to regain hit points equal to Constitution modifier × proficiency bonus, this is the only way for them to heal outside of spells or potions.\nPositive Affinities: Physical, Craft, Fire\nNeutral Affinities: Utility, Earth\nNegative Affinities: Air, Water, Creation\nBonuses: +3 con, +2 str, -3 cha"},"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1-Basic-Mechanics":{"slug":"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1-Basic-Mechanics","filePath":"Chapter 2 - Core Rules/2.1 Basic Mechanics/2.1 Basic Mechanics.md","title":"2.1 Basic Mechanics","links":["Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1-Basic-Mechanics"],"tags":[],"content":"Why this section matters.

You can always come back and reference this section during play."},"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1.0-Dice":{"slug":"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1.0-Dice","filePath":"Chapter 2 - Core Rules/2.1 Basic Mechanics/2.1.0 Dice.md","title":"2.1.0 Dice","links":["Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1.1-Skill-Checks"],"tags":[],"content":"The dice system functions similarly to Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Players will need a standard set of polyhedral dice, including a d20 (20-sided die) for most rolls.\n\nDifficulty Class (DC): The DC is the target number a player must meet or exceed to succeed on a roll. For example, if the DC for climbing a rope is 10, a player who rolls a 10 or higher succeeds. Rolling below the DC results in failure. Rolling significantly higher than the DC (e.g., 15 or higher on a DC 10) can result in a greater success, with the degree of success increasing the more the DC is exceeded (More details are given below).\nAbility Modifiers: Players add their relevant ability modifier to their roll. For example, if a player rolls a 10 and has a +2 modifier, their total is 12 (More details are given below).\nCritical Rolls: Rolling a natural 20 (nat 20) or a natural 1 (nat 1) triggers a critical outcome. There are two ways to handle criticals:\n\nGuaranteed Success/Failure: A nat 20 results in the best possible outcome, while a nat 1 results in the worst. For example, in the rope-climbing scenario, a nat 20 might allow the player to climb the rope near instantly, while a nat 1 might cause them to fall and take damage.\nCritical Roll Bonuses: Instead of an automatic success, a nat 20 allows the player to roll again and add the results together. This system allows for higher DCs (e.g., 30 or more), making challenges more difficult.\n\n\nCrits in Combat: When rolling a Crit on an attack roll (the roll that is contested with a creature’s armor class (AC)) you will always hit no matter the AC and you will always deal the maximum possible damage for your attack. For example, if your attack would normally deal 1d8 + 4 then on a crit you would deal 12 damage without needing to roll.\n\nDifficulty Class\nWhen rolling a d20 for an action check, a character’s success or failure is not always a simple pass/fail. Instead, there are multiple degrees of success that determine how well the action was performed:\n\nCritical Fail (Roll = Natural 1): The action fails in the worst way possible, always with a major negative consequence. \nFailure (Roll &lt; DC): The action fails, producing no positive effect. If the roll is 5 or more below the DC, the failure is exceptionally bad, meaning the GM may introduce additional consequences.\nSuccess (Roll ≥ DC): The action is successful, producing the intended effect.\nGreat Success (Roll ≥ DC +5): The action is completed exceptionally well, potentially adding extra benefits at the GM’s discretion.\nCritical Success (Roll = Natural 20 or Roll ≥ DC +10): The action is executed flawlessly, often with additional bonuses or a major advantage granted by the GM.\n\nExample Applications\n\nJumping a gap (DC 12)\nRoll 9: The character fails and falls.\nRoll 12: The character barely makes it across.\nRoll 17: The character clears the gap with ease.\nRoll 22: The character lands smoothly and could even take an extra step forward.\n\nPersuading a Guard (DC 15)\n\nRoll 10: The guard does not believe you.\nRoll 15: The guard lets you through reluctantly.\nRoll 20: The guard trusts you and offers information.\nRoll 25: The guard gives you access and suggests a safer route.\n\nMore details about skill checks will be provided in 2.1.1 Skill Checks\nModifiers, Proficiency, and Expertise\nModifiers are the bonuses (or penalties) you add to dice rolls based on your character’s core attributes. For example, if you have a Strength of 16, you have a +3 Strength modifier, which applies to actions like Athletics or melee attacks that use Strength.\nProficiency means you’re trained in a particular skill, weapon, or type of gear. When you’re proficient in something, you add your proficiency bonus to your roll. The bonus starts at somewhere around 1-3 (determined by your class) and increases as you level up (usually every few levels based on your class).\n\nIf you’re proficient in a skill (like Stealth or Arcana), you add both your attribute modifier and your proficiency bonus to that skill check.\nIf you’re proficient in a weapon, you can add your Strength or Dexterity modifier (depending on the weapon) to your attack rolls. Without proficiency, you can’t add that modifier and you can’t use special effects or magic from the item.\nYou never add your proficiency bonus to an attack roll, proficiency with a weapon only allows you to add your Strength or Dexterity modifier when you normally would not. \nIf you’re proficient in a type of armor, you gain its full defensive benefits. If you’re not proficient, you suffer penalties and may not be allowed to use it.\n\nExpertise means you are exceptionally skilled at something. In Eyum, this grants advantage on related rolls, meaning you roll twice and take the higher result. Expertise typically applies to weapons, tools, or specific skills you’ve mastered. Some class features or feats allow you to upgrade proficiency into expertise. For example, if you have proficiency with a weapon attack then you would be able to add your Dexterity mod or Strength mod as well as having advantage on the roll.\nTies in Rolls\n\nIf a roll exactly meets the DC, it is considered a success.\nIn contested rolls, if both sides roll the same total result, the tie is broken by:\nThe participant with the higher relevant attribute modifier winning.\nIf still tied, a reroll may take place.\n"},"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1.1-Skill-Checks":{"slug":"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1.1-Skill-Checks","filePath":"Chapter 2 - Core Rules/2.1 Basic Mechanics/2.1.1 Skill Checks.md","title":"2.1.1 Skill Checks","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"When your character attempts a specific action that has a chance of failure, like climbing, searching a room, or persuading an NPC, the GM may call for a skill check. This is typically a roll of a d20 plus the relevant attribute modifier and any proficiency bonuses you may have. The GM sets the Difficulty Class (DC), and if your total roll equals or exceeds the DC, you succeed.\nRequesting a Check\nYou can always ask to make a different kind of skill check if you feel another skill better fits your approach. For example, if the GM asks for an Investigation check, but you explain why a Wisdom-based Insight check makes more sense, the GM may allow it. Likewise, you can describe your actions and ask if they require a roll, the GM will tell you which skill applies. Remember that the Game Master (GM) always gets the final say, if they don’t allow you to choose a different skill, you must abide by their ruling.\nAlternative Modifiers\nMost skills are tied to a specific attribute, but the GM may allow alternative modifiers in special cases. For instance, Intimidation usually uses Charisma, but if you’re trying to intimidate someone through a display of raw physical power (like lifting a boulder or breaking a weapon), the GM might let you roll Strength instead. These substitutions must be justified by your character’s described actions.\nList of Skills by Attribute\nStrength Checks\n\nAthletics - General athletic feats not covered by another skill\nSwimming - Moving through water in difficult or sustained conditions\nClimbing/Running - Scaling surfaces or sprinting long distances\nJumping/Shoving - Leaping gaps or pushing/pulling others\n\nConstitution Checks\n\nSurvival - Resisting poison, disease, or enduring harsh environments\nStamina - Performing long, strenuous activities without rest\n\nDexterity Checks\n\nAcrobatics - Tumbling, flips, or mid-air control\nSleight of Hand - Pick-pocketing or subtle finger-work\nStealth - Avoiding detection by staying unseen or unheard\nLockpicking - Bypassing locks (requires tools)\nTrap Disarming - Disabling mechanical traps or mechanisms\n\nWisdom Checks\n\nAnimal Handling - Calming, directing, or understanding animals\nSituational Insight - Your ability to understand context, recognize patterns, or make logical inferences from subtle environmental cues.\nMedicine - Diagnosing and treating injuries or ailments\nSpot - Noticing things in your general field of view\nReligion - Knowledge of deities, rituals, and doctrines\nNature - Understanding of terrain, plants, and wildlife\nArcana - Basic magic awareness and analysis\n\nIntelligence Checks\n\nInvestigation - Carefully examining something specific to uncover clues.\nSearch - Actively looking for hidden objects, creatures, or features in an area.\nGeneral Reasoning - Logical deduction and analysis\nHistory - Your memory of past events, famous people, lore, and important locations.\n\nCharisma Checks\n\nPersuasion - Convincing someone with charm or reason\nDeception - Lying or misleading others convincingly\nIntimidation - Scaring or threatening others\nPerformance - Singing, dancing, storytelling, etc.\nLeadership - Rallying, directing, or inspiring a group\nSocial Insight - Your ability to read people’s emotions, intentions, or deceptions in a social setting.\n"},"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1.10-Short-and-Long-Rests":{"slug":"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1.10-Short-and-Long-Rests","filePath":"Chapter 2 - Core Rules/2.1 Basic Mechanics/2.1.10 Short and Long Rests.md","title":"2.1.10 Short and Long Rests","links":["Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1.11-Exhaustion"],"tags":[],"content":"Short Rest:\nA short rest is a period of downtime lasting at least 30 minutes, where your character can catch their breath, tend to wounds, etc.\nDuring a short rest, you:\n\nRegain all your Vitality and 50% of your maximum mana\nRefresh certain class features that refresh on a short rest (they will be specified by the skill)\nYou DO NOT regain any HP during a short rest\n\nYou do not gain Vitality or mana during a short rest if you have any levels of exhaustion (See 2.1.11 Exhaustion).\nLong Rest:\nA long rest takes 8 hours of uninterrupted rest or sleep.

Damage is determined differently depending on whether it is a weapon attack or a spell, but all damage is taken from the target’s Vitality first, and then Health once Vitality reaches 0.\nHealth and Vitality will be explained in detail in a later section. For now, understand that Vitality (Vit) represents your stamina and energy. Losing Vitality indicates the effort it takes to avoid or mitigate attacks. Health (HP) represents your actual life force. Taking Health damage is far more dangerous, as it reflects real injury rather than spent energy. For more information on Health and Vitality see 2.4 Health and Vitality.\nWeapon Damage\nTo calculate damage from a melee or ranged weapon:\nDamage = Weapon’s Damage Dice + Relevant Stat Modifier (Strength or Dexterity) + Base Damage\n\nStrength is used for raw force-based attacks (e.g., swinging a hammer or bashing with a shield).\n\nGenerally you would use your Strength mod if you are a Fighter, Barbarian, Paladin, or Strength based Monk.\n\n\nDexterity is used when precision is the goal (e.g., aiming for a weak spot or throwing a knife).\n\nGenerally you would use your Dexterity mod if you are a ranger, rouge, or Dexterity based Monk.\n\n\nYour Base Damage increases primarily through your class, and sometimes through racial traits or other features. Base Damage is divided into three categories: Melee, Ranged, and Magic. When making an attack, use the Base Damage modifier that corresponds to the type of attack (melee, ranged, or magic) being used.\n\nExamples:\n\nA sword that deals 1d8 damage, swung with a Strength modifier of +3 = 1d8 + 3 damage.\nA dagger thrown with a Dexterity modifier of +2 and a +1 damage bonus from enchantment = 1d4 + 2 + 1 damage.\n\nNote: You can choose to use Dexterity or Strength on an attack by attack basis and dealing damage to a specific part of the an enemy using dexterity may invoke disadvantage if it is harder to hit but may have special effects like blinding the creature if it deals damage to Health (once Vitality is drained). This is done at the Game Masters discretion.\nSpell Damage\nTo calculate damage from a spell:\nDamage = Spell’s Base Damage Dice (In the spell description) + Base Damage\nFor the most part the spells will specify how the damage is dealt.\nArea-of-Effect (AoE) Damage\nWhen using an AoE spell or item:\n\nHalf of the damage bypasses Vitality and hits HP directly unless otherwise stated in the spell or item description.\n\nOther Ways to Bypass Vitality\nWhile most damage is applied to Vitality first, certain situations allow damage to bypass Vitality and affect HP directly.\nThese include:\n\nCrits (Nat 20), A critical hit will always bypass Vitality and go directly to HP.\nAttacking a Sleeping or Unconscious Creature, Any successful attack against a creature that is asleep or unconscious is treated as a critical hit and bypasses Vitality, applying full damage directly to HP.\nUndodgeable or Inescapable Damage, If a creature is struck in a situation where evasion is physically impossible, such as being restrained, unaware, or helpless, then Vitality is bypassed. The Game Master (GM) determines whether an attack qualifies as truly unavoidable.\n\nCritical Hits always deal the maximum possible damage from the attack as well as bypassing Vitality.\nExamples:\n\nA sword that deals 1d8 + 4 on hit would deal 8 + 4 = 12 damage on a crit.\nA fire spell that deals 3d10 + 6 would deal 30 + 6 = 36 damage on a crit.\n\nNote: Some abilities, weapons, or spells may still have their own critical hit enhancements.

A creature behind cover is harder to hit.\nThere are three types of cover:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of CoverBonusHalf Cover+2 to AC and Advantage on DEX savesThree-Quarters+5 to AC and Advantage DEX savesTotal CoverCannot be targeted directly\nHigh Ground\nIf a creature has high ground (is at least 1 foot above the head of another creature) it will have advantage on attack rolls against creatures lower than it and creatures beneath it will have disadvantages on attacks made against them. This can by bypassed with specific skills and feats but applies to all attacks made within range.\nFlanking\nWhen you attack a creature from behind while an ally is engaging it from the front, you gain advantage on your attack roll. Additionally, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against your effects during this time.\nOpportunity Attacks\nMoving through an enemy’s reach provokes an opportunity attack. When this occurs, the enemy may use their Reaction (See 2.2 Core Actions) to make a melee attack against you as you pass. This rule applies to all creatures unless a feat, spell, or ability states otherwise. In order to do an opportunity attack you must be wielding a melee weapon. This attack interrupts their movement but does not stop it unless a separate effect applies such as knocking them prone.\nFor example:\n\nIf a monster moves past you, you may make an opportunity attack and vice versa.\n\nHowever, If you move past a monster while invisible or after taking the Disengage action (See 2.2 Core Actions), you do not provoke opportunity attacks."},"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1.7-Mounting-Rules":{"slug":"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1.7-Mounting-Rules","filePath":"Chapter 2 - Core Rules/2.1 Basic Mechanics/2.1.7 Mounting Rules.md","title":"2.1.7 Mounting Rules","links":["Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.3-Turn-Order-and-Initiative/2.3-Turn-Order-and-Initiative"],"tags":[],"content":"Mounting allows characters to ride creatures such as horses, wyverns, or summoned beasts.

If the player meets or exceeds the DC, they succeed (See 2.1.1 Skill Checks).\n\n\nCombat Actions: Combat is a significant part of the game. On their turn, a player can take the following types of actions:\n\nAction: A primary action that takes about 6 seconds (the length of a turn). Examples include attacking or casting a spell. Although an action normally takes a full turn, as you level up you will gain multiple action points (Ap) which will allow taking multiple actions in one turn. This applies to Bonus Actions (BaP) and Reactions (Rp) as well. \nBonus Action: A secondary action, such as equipping a weapon or using a minor ability.\nReaction: A response to another entity’s action, such as an opportunity attack or casting a defensive spell. Players can hold an action (See 2.2.3 Ready Actions (Holding an Action)) to trigger a reaction when specific criteria are met.\nFree Actions: Minor actions that require no time, such as speaking or dropping an item.\n\n\n\nSocial Interactions: Outside of combat, players engage in role-playing conversations with NPCs or each other.

(You are holding one of the standard actions you could normally take.)\nWait for the trigger.\nIf it happens before your next turn, your readied action resolves off-turn like a reaction; otherwise, it expires unused.\n\nWhat can you ready?\nYou may ready any specific action or bonus action you could normally take when it’s your turn (for example, from the “Common actions” list): Attack, Cast a Spell, Use Item, Dash, or Interact with the Environment, as long as you name exactly which one you’re holding.\nExamples\n\n“I wait until the goblin enters the room, then I fire my crossbow.”\n“If the door opens, I fire my bow.”\n“If the sentry steps into the hall, I Dash across to the cover.”\n\nThis allows you to move when it is not your turn, but you must move to a specific location that you specify on your turn.\nMoving past an enemy like this will always provoke Opportunity attacks, even if the Disengage Action was taken on your turn.\n\n\n“If our ally hauls the lever, I Use Item to toss the rope down.”\n\n\nIn every case, you’ll resolve the readied option using the normal rules for that action (e.g., make an Attack roll when you ready Attack).

Initiative determines who acts first and in what sequence the rest of the combatants take their turns. You’ll roll once at the start of a fight, and that order governs the flow of play.\nWhat initiative is (and why it matters)\nInitiative is a simple ranking of all combatants from fastest to slowest for the encounter. High initiative lets you act sooner, move, attack, cast, before your opponents can respond. The GM records the results so everyone knows “who goes when,” and then the table proceeds in that order each round.\nHow initiative is calculated\nAt the start of combat, each character rolls 1d20 and adds their initiative bonus:\nDexterity modifier + any bonuses from race, feats, class abilities, or items.\nTies: If two or more characters roll the same number, the one with the higher Dexterity score goes first. If still tied, those characters reroll to determine who goes first.\nAmbushes and the Surprise Round\nIf one side successfully ambushes the other, the ambushing party always goes first, ignoring normal initiative order for that initial exchange. Resolve a surprise round before regular initiative begins.\n\nDuring the surprise round, all members of the ambushing party take their turns before the actual initiative of the fight. If the ambushers then also win normal initiative, they can effectively take two turns before the unaware side acts (surprise round → first regular round).\nOnly creatures unaware of the ambush are affected. If a creature is immune to surprise or aware of the ambush, it acts during the surprise round like normal.\n\nAfter the surprise round, proceed into the standard initiative order for the rest of combat.\nDelaying your turn\nA character may delay their turn, moving themselves to a lower position in the initiative order for the rest of the combat. This must be declared before taking any actions. Once you choose to delay, your new initiative position is permanent for that encounter.\nOrganizing turns at the table\nTo keep combat readable, we recommend one of two ways to structure the sequence once initiative is set:\n\nGrouped Initiative: All players act together, then all enemies act (or vice versa). Use this for speed and simplicity, fewer hand-offs, quicker rounds.\nIndividual Initiative: Every combatant acts strictly in rolled order. Use this for tactical precision and dramatic tension, this will take longer but is more realistic.\nBoth are valid; choose the one that fits your table’s pacing goals.\n\nQuick flow reference (combat start to first round)\n\nRoll initiative and establish the order. The GM records it.\nIf there’s a successful ambush, run the surprise round first (only against unaware targets as noted).\nProceed through turns using either grouped or individual initiative, per your table’s choice.\nOn your turn, take actions per the turn economy (AP/BAP/Movement; RP when triggered outside your turn).\n"},"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.4-Health-and-Vitality/2.4-Health-and-Vitality":{"slug":"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.4-Health-and-Vitality/2.4-Health-and-Vitality","filePath":"Chapter 2 - Core Rules/2.4 Health and Vitality/2.4 Health and Vitality.md","title":"2.4 Health and Vitality","links":["Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.4-Health-and-Vitality/2.4.1-Injuries"],"tags":[],"content":"What these two pools mean\nHit Points (HP) are your actual health. When HP hits 0, you die (see exceptions below). HP is harder to recover and generally requires healing magic, potions, or rest. Think of HP like “death saves without the randomness”: once you’re taking HP damage, you are actively dying and should disengage or get healed.\nVitality (Vit) is your stamina and evasive buffer, it represents dodges, deflections, and near-misses. Most damage is taken from Vitality first; when Vitality reaches 0, subsequent damage spills into HP. Vitality is easier to restore via rest, potions, or abilities, and the system treats it as a resource you can spend without long-term harm.\nGenerally Speaking all damage is reduced from the target’s Vitality first, and then Health if Vitality reaches 0.\nHow damage interacts with Vitality vs. HP\nThe normal case\n\nSingle-target weapon/spell damage: reduce Vitality first, then HP if Vitality is at 0.\nAfter taking HP damage (not Vitality damage) you run the risk of injuries (see 2.4.1 Injuries)\n\nArea-of-Effect (AoE)\n\nUnless a spell/ability says otherwise, half of the AoE’s damage bypasses Vitality and hits HP directly; the other half applies to Vitality.\n\nOther ways damage can bypass Vitality\n\nSleeping/Unconscious target: any successful hit is a critical and bypasses Vitality, applying full damage to HP.\nUndodgeable/inescapable situations (restrained, helpless, truly unaware): bypass Vitality; the GM judges whether the situation was genuinely unavoidable.\nCritical hits set all damage dice to their maximum before adding modifiers and bypasses Vitality.\n\nDeath and Revival (Read Carefully)\n\nAt 0 HP, a creature dies instantly.\nExceptions:\n• Some feats/features can override death at 0 HP.\n• Some spells/abilities include a revival window (e.g., “revivable within 10 minutes”). If used in time, the creature can return.\nFinality: after 48 hours dead, the soul is unreachable, no magic, ritual, or divine act can restore the creature.\n\n\nPractical note for parties: someone who can heal, or access resurrection-window magic, is strategically vital.\n\nVitality/Hit/Mana Dice\nEach class lists three dice progressions:\n\nVitality Dice - increase your maximum Vitality.\nHit Dice - increase your maximum HP.\nMana Dice - increase your maximum Mana.\n\nWhen a class lists something like Vitality Dice: 2d10+1d12, you roll that full set each time you gain a level in that class and add the total to your maximum Vitality. You never roll just one of those dice, you always roll the full set listed.\n\nExample (from the Handbook): A Fighter with Vitality Dice: 2d12 rolls two d12 every time they gain a Fighter level; add the total to max Vitality.\nMana Dice and your casting stat: When you roll Mana Dice at level-up, add your spellcasting modifier (e.g., Charisma for a Warlock) to the result.\n\nWhen rolling Vitality Dice you add your Constitution Modifier to the final roll.\nWhen Rolling Hit Dice you add nothing.\nWhen Rolling Mana Dice you add your Wisdom Modifier to the final roll.\nMassive Damage Rule\nIf you take ≥ 50% of your maximum HP in one hit, make a DC 10 Constitution save:\n\nFail: you are unconscious until the end of your next turn (or until you take damage again).\nSucceed: you remain standing, but take -1 to all attack rolls on your next turn.\n"},"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.4-Health-and-Vitality/2.4.1-Injuries":{"slug":"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.4-Health-and-Vitality/2.4.1-Injuries","filePath":"Chapter 2 - Core Rules/2.4 Health and Vitality/2.4.1 Injuries.md","title":"2.4.1 Injuries","links":["Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.5-Conditions-and-Status-Effects/2.5.1-List-of-Conditions"],"tags":[],"content":"When to check for an Injury\nYou only ever check when HP is actually harmed (Vitality hits don’t trigger injuries).

If a source explicitly inflicts a listed condition (such as Necrosis or Hellfire), apply that condition as written instead of the table’s default. Each condition includes an x# value indicating how many turns it lasts. Follow the individual condition’s rules for ending it early. Otherwise, the condition automatically ends at the end of its listed duration, regardless of any other timing or effects. If a DC is specified in this table it overwrites the condition table’s standard DC. Conditions from injuries are applied on top of the standard conditions and checks from taking damage from that damage

Just skim to get a sense of what’s possible. When a damage type or resistance shows up in play, you can reference this list.\nPhysical Damage Types\nThese are mundane sources of harm, generally from weapons or bodily force.\n\nSlashing - Caused by blades or claws.\nBludgeoning - Caused by crushing force.\nPiercing - Caused by arrows, spears, stabs.\n\nEach physical damage type has both a magical and non-magical variant. By default, all sources of Slashing, Bludgeoning, or Piercing damage are non-magical. Many creatures have resistance or even immunity to non-magical damage, which means you must deal damage of the magical variant to harm them effectively. Any attack from a spell or magic item that deals physical damage (such as slashing or bludgeoning) automatically counts as magical damage, bypassing resistance or immunity to non-magical damage.\nElemental Damage Types\nThese stem from elemental forces and interact with the environment or conditions.\n\nFire (Heat)\nWater\nEarth\nAir\n\nMagical Damage Types\n\nRadiant - Holy energy.\nNecrotic - Death and decay.\nPsychic - Mind attacks.

Ignores all resistances and immunity.\nRarely dealt except by god-tier spells or final forms.\n\nCombination Damage Types \nCombination Damage Types are advanced damage categories formed by merging two or more elemental or magical sources into a single hybrid effect. Unlike standard types, combination damage is not merely thematic, it has unique gameplay consequences, such as bypassing specific resistances or applying status effects. A creature must resist all components to reduce combination damage. Because of their complexity and layered effects, combination types are often unpredictable and highly situational, rewarding players who prepare for synergy and exploit weaknesses.The effects dealt by special types will apply even while dealing damage to vitality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameFormulaEffect / NotesLightningFire + AirDeals double damage to creatures with the Soaked ConditionSteamFire + WaterScalds flesh (DC 13 CON or 1d4 burn)Ice/ColdWater + AirFreezes flesh, slows movement (−10 ft for 1 round)MagmaFire + EarthDeals Fire + ongoing Burn (1d6 for 2 rounds)MudWater + EarthSlows movement (half speed) for 1d4 roundsSandEarth + AirCauses abrasion (1d4 damage) + blindness (1 round, DC 12 CON)StormLightning + WaterDisorients (-2 to next attack), Deals double damage to creatures with the Soaked ConditionBlightEarth + NecroticPrevents healing for 1 minuteFrostfireFire + ColdDC 15 CON or take 1d8 fire and 1d8 cold extra damageShatterCold + EarthDeals double damage to frozen enemies (enemies who have taken cold damage within 3) or glassToxinAir + NecroticCauses poisoned and necrosis conditions (DC 13 Con)PoisonWater + NecroticCauses poisoned (DC 10 Con)ChaosForce + AirAll damage you deal this turn to this target ignores immunities (but not resistances) (if this damage is dealt first, DC 15 Wis)CursedForce + FireApplies Cursed Condition (DC 10 Wis) for 1 minuteVoidForce + Water + AirPrevents healing for 2 rounds; Pushes back target 5 ft; Target is knocked Prone (DC 14 Str)InfernalForce + Fire + EarthIgnores resistances; causes Hellfire condition (DC 10 Con).GlacialCold + NecroticHalves movement, halves AP (rounded up, minimum of 1) (DC 10 Dex)ThunderAir + ForceKnocks prone (DC 14 Str)StarlightRadiant + AirIlluminates invisible targets; blinds Undead (1 round)AshFire + NecroticBlinds for 1 turn (DC 15 Dex) and deals extra 1d4 fire extra damageSearing WindFire + Air + RadiantDeals 1d4 fire and 1d4 air extra damageTorrentWater + ForcePushes targets 10 ft (DC 14 Str) and deals 1d4 force extra damageObsidianEarth + Cold + NecroticCauses Slow Death condition (DC 10 Con))MetalEarth + Force+1 damage dice per attackQuakeEarth + Force + AirArea ground shock (DC 15 Dex or fall prone)SuffocationAir + Water + NecroticCauses Suffocating condition (Con Save DC 15)WarpForce + PsychicSwap places with caster and object/creatureBloodfireFire + Necrotic + RadiantHeal for half of damage dealtNovaFire + Force + RadiantExplodes outward (20 ft radius, DC 15 Dex, on failed save take 1d8 force damage)DriftCold + AirKnocks flying creatures out of air if they fail Dex Save 15MirageFire + Air + PsychicTarget gains +2 AcSorrowNecrotic + PsychicCauses Despair Condition (DC 10 Wis)CorruptionCursed + Necrotic + ObsidianCauses Corrupt Condition (DC 15 Con)For more information about conditions see 2.5.1 List of Conditions\nResistances, Vulnerabilities, and Immunities\n\nResistance = Half damage\nVulnerability = Double damage\nImmunity = No damage\n\nSome combination types (e.g., Infernal) bypass resistances unless the creature has a specific resistance of vulnerability to that hybrid type, otherwise having resistances or immunities to all components of a damage type will functionally grant resistance or immunity to that damage type."},"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.7-Actually-Playing-The-Game/2.7-Actually-Playing-The-Game":{"slug":"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.7-Actually-Playing-The-Game/2.7-Actually-Playing-The-Game","filePath":"Chapter 2 - Core Rules/2.7 Actually Playing The Game/2.7 Actually Playing The Game.md","title":"2.7 Actually Playing The Game","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nRead this first: This section is meant to be read after you’ve created your character and gone through most of the core rules.

Whether it’s combat, exploration, or roleplay, every player helps the session stay on track and meaningful.\nBe present even off your turn. You may be called on for a reaction, save, or quick decision during someone else’s move, don’t zone out. Put phones away and keep one ear on the scene.\nLet mechanics and narrative support each other. Roleplay doesn’t replace rolls; use your stats and skills when the GM calls for them.\nRespect the spotlight. Don’t dominate scenes; ensure quieter players get time. Rotate focus so everyone shines.\n\nPlayer etiquette\n\nOn your turn: be ready and decisive. Know your abilities, track your resources, and act with intent when your name is called.\nOff your turn: stay engaged. Track initiative, plan your next move, watch for combo setups, and be ready to use reactions.\nSupport others’ moments. If you’ve had the spotlight for a while, wrap and pass it on; when someone else is center stage, enhance their scene with short, in-character responses.\nDon’t metagame. Keep player knowledge separate from character knowledge; let the world surprise you.\nAsk when unsure. Quick, respectful questions keep play smooth; the GM will help and you don’t need every rule memorized.\nMind the table’s tone. Session Zero sets expectations for content and style, play to that agreement.\n\nGM etiquette*\n\nFacilitate fairly and consistently. Use the Handbook as a framework, keep rulings explainable, and maintain consistency to protect immersion.\nListen and share spotlight. Draw quieter players in and keep one player from dominating.\nKeep play moving. If a rule is unclear, make a temporary ruling now and finalize later; don’t change rules mid-combat unless it’s an emergency fix everyone agrees to.\nChallenge, don’t punish. Reward exploration and creativity; never retaliate or “win” against your players.\nDescribe like a camera. Focus on what players would notice; avoid monologues that stall play.\nEncourage collaboration and stay flexible. Build situations where different play-styles rely on each other; listen and adapt as interests change.\n\nHandling disagreements (without derailing the game)\n\nDon’t argue mid-scene. Keep the story moving; rules can be clarified later.\nUse a quick ruling, then revisit. GMs should make a provisional call and continue; finalize the detail after the encounter or session.\nEscalate respectfully after the session. If something still feels wrong, discuss it calmly outside the heat of play. In-game disputes stay in character; out-of-game friction is handled with clarity and care.\nRemember roles. The GM is guide and referee, trust that they’re aiming for fairness and momentum.\n\nWhat to do when it isn’t your turn\n\nTrack the order and the scene. Keep initiative in mind and follow the evolving fiction so you can respond instantly when prompted.\nPrep your next move. Know your options and resources (HP/Vitality, spells, items). Coordinate with allies for setups and defenses.\nStay off your phone and in the world. Distractions make you miss triggers and slow the table down.\n\nIn General\n\nLet others speak and take their turns. Share spotlight and rotate focus so everyone has moments to shine.\nDon’t argue with the GM; clarify later. Use temporary rulings to keep pace; revisit after.\nStay in character; save distractions for breaks. Immersion and focus make sessions smoother and more fun.\nHelp, don’t hijack. Remind each other of abilities, but don’t take over someone else’s choices.\n"},"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.8-Other-Rules/2.8.1-Passive-Perception":{"slug":"Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.8-Other-Rules/2.8.1-Passive-Perception","filePath":"Chapter 2 - Core Rules/2.8 Other Rules/2.8.1 Passive Perception.md","title":"2.8.1 Passive Perception","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"What It Is\nPassive Perception is your character’s ability to notice hidden things without actively looking for them.

Follow it step by step the first time you build a character, and don’t feel rushed. You can always tweak your character later with your GM’s approval.\nWhen creating a character, the first step is to think about their story. It’s best to build characters around their backstory and how they will interact with the game master’s (GM) main narrative. Alternatively, you can focus on mechanics, such as spells, classes, and builds that you find fun to play. However, role-playing should always come first, as it brings your character to life.\nStep 1: Basic Information\nOn your character sheet, fill out the following fields:\n\nName: The name of your character.\nBackground: See 3.5.1 Backgrounds,3.5.2 Titles (or worry about it later).\nRace: Choose from the race list in 3.2 Races\nClass: Choose from the class list in 3.3 Classes\n\nUsually a Campaign will start at level 1 but if your GM allows you to start at a higher level you may want to choose multiple classes for Multiclassing (See 3.3.2 Multiclassing)\n\n\n\nIf you are making your character’s backstory first take note of the following as well;\n\nAge: Choose based on the typical lifespan of your race.\nWeight: Choose based on the average weight of your race.\nHeight: Choose based on the average height of your race.\nBuild: Describe your character’s physique (e.g., muscular, slender, overweight).\nSex: What is your character’s biological sex?\nAlignment: See 3.1.1 Alignment\n\nIt is generally a good idea to have more detailed descriptions of your character’s physical traits and backstory written down separately in your notes. \nStep 2: Attributes\nNext, locate the Attributes section (these are the boxes under the main information, currently we are looking at the Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma boxes).\n\nEach stat starts at 8 (-1) this is a bit below average of a normal human being, so a normal random guy would have an ~12 in all stats if he was perfectly average. 20 is the limit of regular humans, think of an Olympic athlete.\n\nNote: If a stat goes below 1 at any point you die.\n\n\nYou are given 24 points to allocate as you see fit. You can remove points from one stat to add to another, but no stat can go below 4, this allows you to go below average on some stats but not so low you are dysfunctional.\nPoint Costs:\n\nEach point above 20 in a stat costs 2 points instead of 1.\nEach point above 30 costs 3 points, and so on.\n\n\n\nAfter allocating your points, apply any racial modifiers to your stats. For example, if your race grants +1 to Strength and your Strength is 22, set it to 22.5 (this will be rounded down for the modifier).\nCalculating Modifiers\nSubtract 10 from the ability score, then divide the result by 2 and round down. For example, a score of 15 gives a modifier of +2.\nThe modifiers here are for skill checks during play, so if you are supposed to make a skill check in Athletics and you have a +2 modifier then you roll 1d20 and add 2 to the result. \nBelow is a chart for convince, however please note that stats can go above 30 and will follow the same pattern shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility ScoreModifier1–52–3–44–5–36–7–28–9–110–11+012–13+114–15+216–17+318–19+420–21+522–23+624–25+726–27+828–29+930+10\nStep 3: Affinity Chart\nAffinities are for magic, simply just how good you are at specific types of magic. The average skill level of someone with any particular type of magic is a -5, however the skill each one starts at is determined by your race. \nAround the Attributes section, you’ll find the Affinity Chart (This includes the Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Creation, Physical, Craft, Utility, and Generic Boxes; Thermal, Genetic, and Electromagnetic can be ignored for now unless you have chosen the Energyweaver class (See 3.3 Classes In Mixed Classes)).\n\nYou are given 10 points to allocate across the chart. Once spent, these points cannot be reallocated. These points CANNOT be spent in Generic Affinity.\nApply any racial affinities to the chart. Affinities are categorized as follows:\n\nPositive: +0\nNeutral/Not Mentioned: -5\nNegative: -10\n\n\n\nNote: If you choose the Energyweaver you will not gain any racial bonuses in the specialized affinities but the affinity points may be spent on them instead of the normal affinities (worry about this later if you haven’t chosen a class). If you are a beginner it is not recommended you take the Energyweaver class as it is quite difficult to use, so you can probably ignore those boxes for now.\nStep 4: Background and Class\nChoose a background and a class for your character if you haven’t already. Add any bonuses, skills, or features provided by your chosen background and class to your character sheet. At this point, most of your character sheet should be filled out. When selecting your class be sure to apply all of the bonuses this grants, check the Leveling Up section to see what each class gets at level 1 and each other level. \nThink about it like this, your class is like a simple way to measure your profession and how skilled you are in it. A fighter is a person who is good at fighting with weapons and your level in fighter is how good you are at that.\nYour background is what sort of life you lived before becoming an adventurer, there are no specific bonuses and instead it exists for role play. For example, if you were a baker then you would have a background of Baker. This means your character lived their life cooking for people in the past and would know things about cooking, the GM may even allow you to have advantage on cooking related rolls because you have experience in that field. For more information see 3.5.1 Backgrounds,3.5.2 Titles\nStep 5: Starting Stats\nAll characters start with the following:\n\nBap (Bonus Action Points): 1\nAp (Action Points): 1\nRp (Reaction Points): 1\nInitiative: Dexterity Modifier\nAC (Armor Class): 10 + Dexterity Modifier\nPassive Perception: 10 + Wisdom Modifier\nSpeed: Determined by your race.\nSize: Determined by your race.\nStarting Gear: Determined by the GM (See 3.6 Equipment and Starting Gear (WIP)).\n\nRoll a hit dice, vitality, dice, and mana dice (decided by your class) and add those to your maximum stats. Your vitality dice will gain a bonus from your Constitution Modifier. For example, if you roll a 4 for vitality and have a +3 in con then you would have a 7 in vitality starting off. Similarly, your mana dice will gain bonus from your Wisdom Modifier. Your hit dice won’t gain any bonuses. If you have a negative con modifier you will lose some vitality, but your vitality, health and mana cannot go below 1 starting off.\nIt is best to just look at your chosen to see what you get at level 1, it will be different for every class."},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.1-Step-by-Step-Character-Creation/3.1.1-Alignment":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.1-Step-by-Step-Character-Creation/3.1.1-Alignment","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.1 Step-by-Step Character Creation/3.1.1 Alignment.md","title":"3.1.1 Alignment","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Alignment describes a character’s general worldview and moral tendencies.

They’re one of the simplest classes to play, gaining steady increases to damage and accuracy with every level. Fighters don’t use spells or flashy powers, they just hit hard, wear solid armor, and get better at doing both over time. This makes them an excellent beginner class for players who want to focus purely on combat without worrying about resources or complicated mechanics. However, Fighters can lack flexibility compared to more advanced classes and don’t scale as explosively into the late game.\nBarbarian\nBarbarians are built to survive. They have the highest vitality scaling of any class and can reduce all incoming damage while raging. Although their accuracy isn’t the highest, they’re excellent at staying in the front lines and drawing aggro. Barbarians can’t use ranged weapons, and they don’t get any magical abilities, so they rely entirely on brute force and toughness. They’re easy to play and hard to kill, making them ideal for players who want to charge into battle and take hits that would drop any other character.\nMonk\nMonks are unarmored martial artists who fight with fists and inner energy called Ki. They scale rapidly in mobility, speed, and action economy, becoming one of the most mechanically dynamic melee classes. A Monk can’t be disarmed, gets powerful subclass techniques, and eventually becomes faster and more accurate than nearly anyone else. That said, Monks are more complex than Fighters or Barbarians, and require thoughtful resource management and positioning to shine. They also don’t generally use standard weapons, so you miss out on cool magical items. They’re great for players who want a mix of martial power and battlefield mobility.\nRanged Classes\nRogue\nRogues are agile, cunning combatants who deal high damage by exploiting enemy weaknesses through Sneak Attack. They are most effective when paired with allies or positioned strategically to ambush or outmaneuver opponents. Rogues excel at stealth, traps, and skill checks, but they are fragile and rely on positioning and reactions to avoid danger. Their toolkit is extremely powerful but slightly more complex than other martial classes, so they’re a great fit for players who like tactical thinking and creative problem-solving.\nRanger\nRangers are long-ranged specialists who use bows and terrain familiarity to eliminate enemies from a distance. They are the most straightforward ranged classes, with strong accuracy and consistent damage over time. Rangers don’t have many flashy abilities, but they’re easy to learn and reliable in nearly every situation. This is a great pick for players who want a simple but effective “sniper” archetype.\nSpellcasting Classes\nCleric\nClerics are divine spellcasters who draw power from a god and specialize in healing, buffs, and radiant magic. They are the only class capable of reviving the dead without items, making them essential in high-risk campaigns. Clerics scale well with affinity, mana, and action economy, and their subclass (called a domain) determines their magical focus. However, Clerics must uphold their chosen god’s ideals to keep their powers, which can restrict choices in roleplay or tactics. They are best for players who want to protect their allies, heal effectively, and follow a divine path.\nWarlock\nWarlocks gain magic by forming a pact with a powerful entity, often a god, demon, or ancient monster. They excel in damage, curses, and utility magic. Each Warlock entity (called a patron) drastically changes how the class plays, offering abilities like transformation, necromancy, or battlefield control. Warlocks scale well and are highly flexible, but their powers are tied to the patron they serve, which can lead to consequences if the pact is broken. They’re great for players who enjoy roleplaying powerful but morally complicated characters with heavy-hitting magic.\nWizard\nWizards are the most versatile and efficient spellcasters in the game. They learn more spells than any other class and can control nearly any situation with AoEs, illusions, teleports, or force spells. Wizards scale fast in mana and spell variety, but they are physically weak and have fewer defenses than other classes. Smart positioning and spell selection are crucial. This is the perfect class for players who want deep spell lists, high adaptability, and a “glass cannon” play-style.\nSorcerer\nSorcerers are born with innate magical power, unleashing devastating spells powered by raw force. They get fewer spells than other casters but make up for it with higher spell damage and unique effects. Sorcerers are especially strong at low levels but burn through mana quickly and struggle with long fights unless carefully managed. They’re best suited for players who want to deal huge damage quickly and don’t mind being a bit fragile or limited in sustained casting.\nDruid\nDruids are spellcasters tied to nature, capable of healing, controlling terrain, summoning weather, and even shape-shifting into animals. They’re versatile and flavorful, but their effectiveness depends on preparation and knowing which spells to pick. Druids have a major downside in that they cannot use their magic in a way that harms nature. Druids are ideal for players who want to shift between healing, support, and damage roles while embracing a nature theme.\nSpecialist Classes\nPaladin\nPaladins are hybrid warrior-spellcasters bound by a personal oath. They can use melee weapons, cast healing or radiant spells, and even engage in ranged combat depending on build. Their biggest strength is versatility, they can fill any party role, but they never become the best at any single one. Their powers are tied to a moral or narrative Oath, and breaking that oath can lead to penalties and loss of power. Paladins are great for players who want flexibility and enjoy roleplaying a character with clear values and conviction.\nBard\nBards are magical performers who use music, speech, and charm to support allies and manipulate enemies. Their spells focus on inspiration, crowd control, and utility, and they have some of the highest survivability among casters. Bards also get more skill points and social interaction tools than most classes, making them great outside of combat too. They are easy to play and very flexible, ideal for players who like helping the team, talking their way through problems, or being the group’s emotional core. Bards are the most skilled class, they are usually good at basically everything outside of combat, so skill checks will be your friend.\nAlchemist\nAlchemists are complex crafting-focused characters who create potions, bombs, and chemical mixtures instead of casting spells. They must plan ahead by preparing formulas during rests, which can heal allies, deal massive AoE damage, or cause debuffs and terrain effects. Alchemists have incredible potential, but they are not recommended for beginners due to their complexity and reliance on inventory and timing. This class is perfect for experienced players who enjoy prep-heavy, support/control roles with flexible utility.\nRunemaster\nRunemasters inscribe magical runes to affect the battlefield, their gear, or themselves. Their spells take longer to set up than traditional magic, but can be extremely powerful when timed well. A Runemaster can alter terrain, empower attacks, or seal off entire areas. However, mastering runes takes planning and system knowledge, making them one of the hardest classes to play. Ideal for players who like long-term setup, creative combos, and playing the “chess-master” of the group.\nEnergyweaver\nEnergyweavers are advanced casters who manipulate real-world energy, heat, motion, electricity, and more, using scientific principles instead of mana or spells. Every action must follow physics: energy must be sourced from somewhere and redirected into something else. Players choose from Energy Actions like Thermal Transfer or Kinetic Shock, using a pool of Joules to fuel effects each turn. Success depends on managing Energy Affinities, distance penalties, and physics-based reactions, which can backfire or damage the caster if handled incorrectly. This class is extremely powerful, but only in the hands of players who can think in physics, math, and momentum. It is not recommended for beginners, as each turn involves complex targeting and equation-based choices"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.1-Step-by-Step-Character-Creation/3.1.5-Building-Your-Backstory":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.1-Step-by-Step-Character-Creation/3.1.5-Building-Your-Backstory","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.1 Step-by-Step Character Creation/3.1.5 Building Your Backstory.md","title":"3.1.5 Building Your Backstory","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Your backstory helps define who your character is and why they do what they do. Instead of using premade traits or bonds, we just ask you to write your own backstory. The following questions don’t all need to be answered, but answering them in your backstory will provide the GM with ample material to work you into the world and story.\nQuestions\n\nWhat mattered most to you before this journey?\n\nThis could be a person, a belief, a goal, or a fear. What shaped you before the adventure began?\n\n\nWhy did you leave that behind?\n\nWhether by choice, force, or tragedy, what pushed you to change? Even if you’re not ready to talk about it yet, your character knows.\n\n\nWhat do you secretly hope for?\n\nBeneath the armor or attitude, what desire lingers? Redemption, glory, peace, revenge, love? You don’t have to admit it to the party. Ie what is your character’s motivation? \n\n\nWho (or what) would you die to protect?\n\nThis can be someone real, a cause, a place, or even your own identity. It’s the line your character won’t cross or surrender.\n\n\nWhat would truly break you?\n\nNot every character needs to be broken, but knowing what would ruin them adds depth. Is it failure, betrayal, loneliness, or something worse?\n\n\n\nTips for Writing\n\nTry to avoid perfect or flawless characters. Flaws aren’t bad, they give you room to grow.\nIf your backstory is short, that’s fine. If it’s long, make sure your GM has time to read it (and is okay with spending the time to read it).\n"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/3.2-Races":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/3.2-Races","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/3.2 Races.md","title":"3.2 Races","links":["Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Avian","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Centaur","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Chelonar","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Fewiuo","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Naga","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Stingerfolk","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Strigari","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Thryz","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Veltraxi","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Racial-Modifiers/Therianthropes","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Aurian","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Broodweaver","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Dwarf","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Elf","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Elnar","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Ferramite","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Giant","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Halofade","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Racial-Modifiers/Halfling","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Human","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Iceborn","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Ignites","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Kravari","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Lumari","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Unique-Races/Mirr","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Unique-Races/Mycelari","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Nyctaris","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Opkathian","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Sandmen","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Snerin","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Spritelings","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Sylphmare","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Varkun","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Zephar","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Zontian","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Boaf","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Brogath","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Cyclops","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Galdrani","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Gorul","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Grivlit","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Grull","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Harpy","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Minotaur","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Mireglopians","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Naram-Sin","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Salamandrians","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Siren","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Slarik","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Stonekin","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Thauryx","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Troll","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Tull","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Undead-Races/Noskara","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Undead-Races/Relicwraith","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Unique-Races/Ent","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Unique-Races/Skinwalker","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Unique-Races/Wicklin","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Racial-Modifiers/Werewolf-(Lycanthrope)","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Undead-Races/Rotborn","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Undead-Races/Veythari","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Undead-Races/Witherkin"],"tags":[],"content":"Below is a list of every race currently in Eyum TTRPG.

Their facial features blend avian sharpness with humanoid symmetry, possessing curved beaks, narrow eyes, and crests that rise when agitated or inspired. Their arms end in strong, clawed hands, while large, powerful wings protrude from their back, allowing for bursts of flight at extraordinary speed. Though humanoid in structure, their entire frame is optimized for aerial movement: light bones, muscular legs, and a sweeping wingspan often greater than their height. Their voices carry a melodious, hollow quality, with speech often laced with tonal shifts like birdsong.\nCulture: Avian society is deeply spiritual and guided by principles of freedom, neutrality, and celestial order. They believe themselves to be born from the sky’s breath and view the world below as sacred, but dangerous. Avians tend to live in cliffside nests, floating towers, or wind-blown peaks, far from conflict and grounded politics. Peaceful by nature, they avoid interference with other races unless compelled by moral obligation. When an Avian witnesses injustice or cruelty, their deep sense of cosmic balance pushes them to act, often swooping in with deadly precision, then disappearing before their presence can shift the world’s course. Their laws are simple but absolute: never betray kin, never cage another, never kill without cause. Avians admire clarity, swiftness, and justice, and their elders are revered not for power but for consistency of purpose. Those who lose their wings (due to injury or exile) are seen as cursed or fallen, often choosing a life of silence and solitude.\nOther:\n\nAerial Dash: While airborne, you may take a Dash action as a bonus action.\nWind Mastery: When dealing non-magical damage add 1d8 air damage to the attack.\n\nPositive Affinities: Air, Fire, Physical\nNeutral Affinities: Generic, Water, Creation, Utility\nNegative Affinities: Earth, Craft\nBonuses: +4 DEX, -2 INT"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Centaur":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Centaur","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Animalistic Races/Centaur.md","title":"Centaur","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 6’6 - 8’0\nWeight: 500 - 900 lbs\nLifespan: 70 - 120 years\nSize: Large\nSpeed: 60 ft\nLanguage: Common\nDescription: Centaurs are powerful, half equine, half humanoid nomads. From the waist down they bear the muscular frame of a warhorse, heavy with working muscle, thick fetlocks, and sure footed hooves. Above, a broad shouldered humanoid torso carries bow, spear, and burden with practiced ease. Coats range from bay and dapple gray to rare piebalds and midnight black, while skin and hair follow the human spectrum, often braided and bound with beads, bone totems, and weather worn cords. Eyes stay keen and steady, nostrils flare to read wind, and breath fogs in cold air like a draft animal at work. Tack jingles when they move, hooves drum a cadence that becomes thunder at a charge, and even at rest their weight seems rooted to the ground. They favor durable leather, woven saddle blankets, and bandoliers that keep tools ready at a run.\nCulture: Herds roam grass seas, scrublands, and the open margins of forest, tracing seasonal graze and star paths kept by chant and hoof prints. Law is oral and immediate, elders arbitrate, champions defend, scouts decide the route, and all share the load. Oaths matter, trade promises, escort contracts, and grazing treaties are witnessed by the whole herd and repeated until even foals can speak them. Camps are circular and efficient, ringed with standing poles and wind bells that sing the weather’s temper. Walls are distrusted, heavy roofs dull the senses, so Centaurs prize open horizons, practical craft, and endurance over ornament. An oath breaker is cast out to walk alone until honor is reclaimed by service or sacrifice. Foals learn bowcraft at a run, and even elders drill dawn charges to keep the herd’s rhythm. Guests who respect the ring and pull their weight eat well and travel safely, those who cheat the circle find the trail behind them empty and the plains ahead unfriendly.\nOther:\n\nSure Footed: You have advantage on checks and saving throws to resist being knocked prone or shoved by effects that push or trip you.\nTrampling Charge: If you move at least 20 ft straight toward a creature and hit it with a Hooves attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a Strength save, DC 12 + Proficiency Bonus + STR mod, or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, you may make one extra Hooves attack against it as a bonus action.\nHooves: Your hooves are natural weapons that deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. You are proficient with your hooves.\nQuadruped Frame: Tight passages less than 10 ft wide count as squeezing for you. Ladders and narrow vertical shafts require a secure ramp or specialized tackle at GM discretion.\nPack Runner: When you take the Dash action in natural terrain, ignore the first 10 ft of nonmagical difficult terrain you enter during that movement.\n\nPositive Affinities: Physical, Earth, Utility\nNeutral Affinities: Generic, Air\nNegative Affinities: Water, Craft, Creation\nBonuses: +3 STR, +1 CON, +1 WIS, -2 INT"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Chelonar":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Chelonar","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Animalistic Races/Chelonar.md","title":"Chelonar","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 4’5 - 6’0\nWeight: 300 - 500 lbs\nLifespan: 200 - 500 years\nSize: Medium\nSpeed: 20 ft\nLanguage: Common, Cheloni\nDescription: Chelonar are humanoids with broad, domed shells fused to the spine and ribs, their limbs thick with scaled skin and their heads smooth and beaked. Eyes remain steady and unblinking, and shell patterns range from bright, lacquered swirls to mottled stone tones depending on region. They move with deliberation rather than haste; steps are planted, weight tested, and silence valued over speed. Hands are strong and square-fingered, ideal for grinding tools, carving channels in stone, or bracing a shield-line for hours. Their homes are laid into cliffsides and river-cut canyons, engineered to last centuries: water-diverters, root-stays, and stone ribs that flex without breaking. Clothing trends toward layered work-wraps, tool loops, and resin-sealed shawls that shed grit and spray. Voices are low and measured; elders cultivate a cadence like slowly stacked stones, where meaning sits heavy at the end of a sentence.\nCulture: Time is the master teacher. Chelonar councils sit for seasons before shifting a law by a finger’s breadth; change is only good if it endures. Communal memory is sacred: long-span ledgers etched into shell-tiles record floods, harvests, and promises. Youth serve rotations as runners, carpers, and archivists before declaring a life craft. Pacifists by philosophy, they mark their borders with cairns and prayer-rings; cross them with violence, and defenders rise like a moving wall, silent, implacable, and unwilling to yield even a handspan. Duty, memory, and groundedness form their triad of virtue. Outsiders sometimes mistake their calm for slowness; in truth, Chelonar prefer precision to hurry. They honor those who build: keepers of water, menders of roads, and guardians who survive the waiting years between storms. When a shell is cracked in service, the community inlays it with metal seams and river-stone, turning scars into scripture.\nOther:\n\nShell-Tuck: As a bonus action, retreat into your shell. You gain +4 AC and your movement becomes 0. While tucked, you cannot take actions, bonus actions, or reactions.

Their upper bodies are largely human in proportion, but their legs are reverse jointed and scaled, ending in razor talons that bite into stone and bark with equal confidence. Wings define them, great fans of feathers that differ wildly in span and pattern between lineages. Some Fewiuo carry long, sail-like primaries for distance riding, others bear compact, muscular wings for brutal stops and explosive turns. Their bones are light, their torsos lean, and their shoulders are corded for lift and control. Eyes cut bright against their plumage and catch detail at impossible distances. Garb favors motion, layered wraps that do not catch the wind, with harness points for tools, instruments, or trophies won in flight. To groundfolk, Fewiuo often read as statuesque or startling, especially white-feathered stock, but every subrace carries its own posture and pride.\nCulture: Freedom is the Fewiuo heartbeat. They build lives in open air and high country, cliff nests and cloudlines, ruins turned into roosts, and schooners refit as sky-lodges. Flocks form by choice rather than decree, bands of kin and comrades held together by affection, practice, and promise, not law. Their art is motion, music and dance braided through storytelling, and disputes settle in contests of skill, loops and dives meant to test nerve more than draw blood. Though easy with laughter, they guard their flocks fiercely, and a slight against one is answered by many. Customs diverge by lineage, from the oath-steady Clauio to the mirror-bright vanity of Angeliuo, but all Fewiuo honor the right to rise, to leave, to return changed. When storms come, they mark the wind with ribbons and whistle-codes, log the currents, and pass maps forward, building a sky-memory as old as their bones.\nOther:\n\nKeen Eyes: You have proficiency in Search and Spot.\nAerial Poise: While flying, you have advantage on Acrobatics checks, and you ignore the first 10 feet of forced movement from wind or similar effects.\nAerial Dash: While airborne, you may take a Dash action as a bonus action.\nTalon Purchase: You have advantage on checks to maintain your grip (climbing checks) when climbing natural stone, wood, or rope.\n\nSubraces\nClauio\nSleek, black-feathered warriors with long legs and oversized talons, bred for decisive dives and hard stops in close quarters.\n\nBonuses: +2 STR, +1 DEX.\nStorm Wings: You have a 50 ft flight speed.\nRaptor Talons: You have a natural talon attack (1d6 slashing, finesse).\nHorizon Sight: You have expertise in spot.\n\nCheliuo\nSmall, bright-plumed, with underdeveloped wings better for catching air than climbing it.\n\nBonuses: +6 CHA, +1 WIS.\nThermal Glide: You cannot gain altitude unaided.

Scale patterns and colors mark lineage, deep reds and greens to stark white or pitch black. Faces are sharp, eyes narrow, and some lineages bear true fangs while others are fangless. Their tails drive impressive speed, coil for leverage or intimidation, and let many rear upright to strike with an imposing silhouette.\nCulture: Naga prize strength, skill, and cunning. Standing in society is earned by proven ability rather than birthright. Competition is constant and pragmatic, power maintains order and unchecked weakness invites collapse. Alliances form and dissolve on mutual benefit, and betrayal is treated as a tool, not a moral failure, so oaths are written narrowly and enforced strictly.\nOther:\n\nSerpentine Resilience: Resistance to poison damage and heat damage.\nAmphibious: You can breathe underwater continuously for up to 1 hour.\nDarkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.\n\nSubraces\nWhen creating a Naga character you may choose a subrace.

Heavy chitin plates band chest, shoulders, hips, and thighs, with flexible joints webbed by softer segments that still shrug off blade edges. Hands end in thick, split claws fit for crushing grips and hook pulls, while a massive scorpion tail rises from the lower back, jointed in long arcs, the final segment housing a recurved sting that drips with clear, bitter venom. Faces are rigid and angular, mandible like jaws tightening when they focus, and their segmented eyes take on glassy reds or harsh yellows that drink detail from glare and shadow. They move low and coiled, weight close to the ground until the moment breaks, then the whole frame unspools in a decisive strike. Carapace tones run matte black, umber, and sandy bronze, often dusted to match the dunes and scrub where they range. Armor and clothing are spare and functional, webbed belts for water stones, bone or metal sign rings placed along the tail, and clan marks etched where plates will not chip.\nCulture: Stingerfolk build their society on pride tempered by discipline, loyalty proven by labor, and honor measured in formation rather than boasting. Households gather into hives and warbands, each member drilled to know a role and to hold it without complaint, scout, shield line, vanguard, quartermaster, sting medic. Commands are crisp and repeated until they become rhythm, call and answer patterns are tapped on tail rings and armor plates so orders carry through dust, wind, and chaos. Oaths are public and lifelong, sealed with a cut of the sting tip and witnessed by the unit, and an oath breaker is cut from the roll without drama and without appeal. Betrayal is rare because memory is long and ledgers are kept clear, favors owed and harms done are recorded in plain script, paid down steadily, never forgotten. Instruction begins early, younglings learn balance, restraint, and tail control before they are trusted with a weapon, and every adult trains both a martial craft and a practical trade so the hive can march and mend without asking favors. Hospitality is formal but real, allies who carry their share and keep their word are fed, armed, and guarded until the bond is met, then sent on with marks of safe passage. Outsiders often mistake silence for hostility and size for cruelty, yet among their own the Stingerfolk are poets of violence, tacticians of precision, and careful keepers of order, reciting battle epics at dusk, drilling silent maneuvers at dawn, and measuring leadership by calm hands and clean decisions rather than loud speeches.\nOther:\n\nChitin Plating: While not wearing manufactured armor, your natural armor sets your AC to 13 + CON mod.\nVenom Engine: Your tail is a natural weapon with reach 10 ft that deals 1d6 piercing damage. On a hit, the target must succeed on a CON save, DC 12 + Proficiency Bonus + CON mod, or suffer 1d6 poison damage and -1 Base Acc until the end of its next turn.\nCrushing Claws: Your claws are natural weapons that deal 1d6 slashing damage.

While you are grappling a creature, you may make one sting attack against it as a bonus action on your turn.\nDesert Forbearance: You can go up to 5 days without food or water, and sand does not count as difficult terrain for you.\nToxin and Flame Proof: You are immune to poison damage and to heat based damage.\nDarkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.\n\nColor Variants\nEach color lineage refines a different discipline.

Feathers lie in tight, matte layers that drink sound, wings articulate with owlish elasticity, and the face forms a flat disc that funnels the faintest whisper to luminous eyes. Hands are true hands with talon tips, capable of scribing and surgery, yet cruel when needed. Most carry cloaks, cords, and ledgers stitched from preserved feathers and leathers, a portable archive of names, debts, and rulings. In darkness they move like a closing thought, weight balanced over the toes, shoulders tucked to break wind, breath held until the moment to speak. Voices come low and breathy, a hush that makes listeners lean forward.\nCulture: Strigari keep high, hidden aeries where memory is law. They watch, they record, they judge, every oath etched into family ledgers, every debt indexed by night, and every verdict spoken once, then carried forward as precedent. They speak rarely and with care, since a careless word stains the ledger, and a broken promise stains the name. Kin flocks are bound by oaths that outlive individuals, a Strigari will cross continents to fulfill a promise that an ancestor signed. In dealings with other avian peoples they are proud to the point of offense, convinced that their discipline and silence prove superiority. They will aid a flock that shows proper respect, they will correct a flock that does not, and they will never apologize for the correction. Silence, to them, is not weakness, it is the weight of truth, and speech is a tool used only when precision matters.\nOther:\n\nNight Sight: You have darkvision to 60 ft, and you have advantage on Search checks made in dim light.\nSilent Wings: While flying, if you move no more than half your flying speed on your turn, you have advantage on Stealth checks, and creatures have disadvantage on Spot checks to find.\nTalon Hands: Your talons are natural weapons that deal 1d4 slashing damage on a hit.\nSky Supremacy: You have advantage on Intimidation checks directed at non-Strigari avian (bird like) races, and you have disadvantage on Persuasion checks directed at them.\n\nPositive Affinities: Air, Utility, Water\nNeutral Affinities: Generic, Creation\nNegative Affinities: Earth, Fire, Physical\nBonuses: +4 WIS, +2 DEX, -3 STR"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Thryz":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Animalistic-Races/Thryz","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Animalistic Races/Thryz.md","title":"Thryz","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 5’5 - 6’5\nWeight: 150 - 240 lbs\nLifespan: 30 - 50 years\nSize: Medium\nSpeed: 35 ft\nLanguage: Common, Thryzic\nDescription: Thryz are chitin-armored insectoids built for speed, leverage, and ruthless efficiency. Their bodies are segmented and jointed in unfamiliar ways, hips that swivel farther than mammalian norms, knees that coil like springs, shoulders that ratchet forward for sudden reach. Four arms define their silhouette, two are dexterous, tool-ready manipulators, two are bladed forelimbs reminiscent of mantis scythes, ridged and angled to bite through hide and cordage. Carapaces shimmer in metallic hues, bronze, emerald, and sapphire tones are common, each plate set with fine sutures that flex without cracking. Compound eyes gather and compare motion across dozens of facets, a glittering array that reads wind, shadow, and the twitch of a bowstring. Mouthparts are masked by a hardened lip when speaking with other peoples, but pull back in combat to reveal shearing mandibles. When at rest they are statuesque, when the signal comes they explode into motion, a click of tarsal spurs, a blur of forelimbs, a clean finish.\nCulture: Thryz societies are hive-fortresses carved under wastelands and mountains, architecture that flows like grown resin, galleries on galleries tied by helical ramps and kill-corridors. Caste is function, not birth, strength, speed, and intellect determine one’s role, and roles can change if a worker proves a thinker or a cutter becomes a tactician. From clutch-day, Thryz are taught that the hive is an extension of self, a thousand limbs, a single purpose, so they do not lie, because lies weaken the geometry of trust. This does not make them naïve, it makes them literal, bargains are etched, duties accounted, failures owned. Diplomacy is rare, but when offered it is ritual and binding, a formal recognition that another people has earned a place in the ledger. Bonds with clutchmates run deep, grief is recorded on the carapace in scored lines that other Thryz can read with their fingertips. Outsiders fear the look of them and the efficiency of their combat drills, but those who travel with a Thryz cohort learn the cadence of their care, water shared, watches held, tools returned to the hand that needs them next.\nOther:\n\nChitin Plating: You have resistance to non-magical slashing damage.\nDarkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.\nQuartet Limbs: You can wield and manipulate objects with four arms.

Their feet end in grasping talons, their forearms are true arms rather than wings, and along the shoulders and spine grow vestigial fans of feathers that shiver when the wind shifts. Black, oil-blue, and charcoal are common base colors, shot through with iridescent sheens like wet slate. They carry themselves low and forward, heads cocked, eyes wide and glassy, watching and listening even while they speak. Their voices are haunted by mimicry, sentences stitched from scraps of overheard conversation, street cries, lullabies, and prayer-ends, delivered with unnerving accuracy. Clothing is practical and light, belts and wraps that do not flap, pockets stitched on the inside for quiet hands, trophies and trinkets braided into cords at the neck or ankle. They are quick to stillness, quicker to motion, and seldom waste a gesture.\nCulture: Veltraxi live where wind and ruin meet, cliff warrens above the surf, dead districts of abandoned cities, bell towers and skeletal bridges. They scavenge out of habit and philosophy, what is unguarded belongs to the wind, what is guarded invites a better plan. Flocks are loose and leaderless, authority is the voice that convinces in the moment, and memory is kept in echoes, a chorus of repeated phrases that turns news into map and warning. They value knowledge over law and survival over pride, so a clever trick that keeps the flock fed is a virtue. Many become spies, scouts, and infiltrators, trading secrets for shelter. Their reputation as thieves is not entirely wrong, but among themselves the line between theft and salvage is a matter of wit and timing. They train their young to watch without blinking, to listen without interrupting, and to talk only when the words can change the outcome.\nOther:\n\nPerfect Mimicry: You can reproduce voices and common sounds you have heard within the last 24 hours. You have advantage on Deception checks to impersonate a specific speaker.\nCrow’s Cunning: You have proficiency in Sleight of Hand and Lockpicking.

Eyes are a constant, vivid red, set beneath calm brows that rarely betray emotion. Features trend elegant and spare, cheekbones cut fine, hands steady and precise. The men often build dense, sculpted muscle as a deliberate discipline, while the women tend toward a tensile, glass-like lightness that conceals hard strength. Their movements are economical, every gesture measured as if it were an equation being solved. Voices are level and unhurried, the cadence of teachers and magistrates, and even casual speech can feel like a ruling delivered from a dais. These traits align with their recorded baseline, pale skin that glows softly in moonlight, ever-red eyes, and a bearing that reads analytical rather than warm. Their skin is usually a tan brown and their hair usually a light gray or white.\nCulture: Aurians seclude themselves in arcane towers raised atop ruined foundations or in rune-wreathed cloisters that overlook the old world. They measure life in treatises and experiments, copying the script of reality until it bends for them. Children memorize sigils before histories, and households keep family grimoires that pass from hand to hand like titles. Power is administered by Runemasters whose edicts set the rhythm of trade, defense, and study. The surface order is strict and shining, but beneath it lies a competitive austerity, scholars test rivals with cleverly framed bindings, apprentices argue precedence in dueling circles, and kin compete for the right to engrave their names in the master indexes. Outsiders are tolerated as variables to control for, not partners to trust, which is why Aurian diplomacy is formal, contractual, and often brief. Their recorded entry emphasizes the same pillars, isolated enclaves, generational obsession with runes, hierarchical rule by Runemasters, and a disciplined society that can turn ruthless behind the facade of order.\nOther:\n\nSpellcasting Prowess: +1 to your Spell Casting Modifier.\nGlyphsense: You have advantage on Search checks to detect magical traps and on Investigation checks to analyze their triggers and effects.\nCounter-Sigil: Once per combat, when you make a saving throw against a spell or runic effect, you may use your reaction to add +2 to that roll.\nTower Scholar: You are proficient in History.

Four glossy black eyes watch from a calm, unreadable face, two set where a human’s would be and two smaller ones high on the brow. Their hair grows in saturated colors, cobalt, poison green, bruise purple, and is often worn short to keep it from sticking. At a glance they look soft, but up close tiny setae give their palms and fingers a subtle grip, and their skin smells faintly of clean resin. The unsettling part is not the look, it is the way their attention divides without effort, one pair of eyes tracking a room while the other fixes on a single pulse or gesture. When they are stressed or focused, pearly seams open along the ribs or spine and a bead of living gel extrudes, shaping into a skittering broodling that drops to the floor and scurries off at an unspoken command.\nCulture: There is no single homeland and no unified creed. Most Broodweavers live where numbers hide them best, dense cities, dock alleys, stacked slums, service tunnels. They rent rooms under simple names, take practical work, and keep their heads down. The brood does the errands, scouting gutters, climbing vents, and crowding the ankles of a target until nerves fray. Small crews form for short jobs, then disperse before attention sticks. A Broodweaver’s idea of community is simple, keep the nest dry, keep the food shared, keep the noise down, and if hunters come, move fast and leave nothing that can point back.\nOther:\n\nFour Eyes: You are proficient in Search and Spot.\nBudding, create broodling: As an action, create 1 broodling in an empty space within 5 ft.

Barrel chests carry thick corded muscle, legs are short but coiled with power, and hands are square and calloused from tool and tongs. Beards are a ledger you can read at a glance, braided with metal clasps, polished stones, and rune-tags that record clan, craft, and deeds. Skin runs from ash brown to ruddy copper, eyes catch light like ore veined through stone, and even at four feet a dwarf stands with the grounded presence of a peak. They work in heat and smoke without complaint, withstand pressure and poison that would drop taller folk, and seem to settle into any space like they were always meant to be there. Their clothing favors layered work-leather, aprons dark with oil, and belts heavy with chisels and punches. Even at rest they keep a tool in hand, a file smoothing an edge that no one else could feel.\nCulture: Dwarven society is laid deep into bedrock, cavern-cities carved where mountain hearts beat warm, and long halls bored under scorched plains where the bed of the world runs close. Every cut channel, each engraved rune, is an echo of the Prime Stone, the first pattern from which all craft descends. Speech is measured and spare, feeling is held tight and given slowly, but once a bond is struck it is iron, and a broken vow is remembered for generations. Councils are led by masters of craft, by runesmiths and metallurgists whose signatures are as binding as law. Feasts mark completed spans of wall, a well struck exactly where water would be, a vein opened without collapse. Rituals of honor turn hands to the workbench and eyes to the ledger, family names joined to tools that outlive their owners. Grudges are not tantrums, they are records, and reconciliation takes the same patience and pressure as laying a keystone.

Their features are precise and symmetrical, a sculpted beauty that reads as intentional rather than accidental. Eyes shine in greens, silvers, and golds, hair grows in deep black, silver white, and forest greens that seem to hold their own light. They move with quiet certainty, not as creatures walking on the world but as beings nested within it, steps placed as if they already knew where the ground would welcome them. Conversation comes measured and exact, each word chosen like a rune being set, every pause long enough to weigh meaning. To shorter lived peoples they can feel mesmerizing and alien, a touch too perfect, a touch too deliberate, as though time has sanded away every wasted motion.\nCulture: Elves are ancient and widespread, their ways braided with place. Beneath the Crystal Veil they build radiant cities under crystal towers humming with forgotten magics, in the Iron Spire they weave tree palaces out of living root and spell, and along the long roads they wander as story keepers, moving from glade to ruin to high ridge collecting moments rather than coin. Across these branches runs a common thread, a detached view of time and relationship. Family names do not anchor them, lineage is oral if remembered at all, and identity is earned through deed, role, or title taken on for a century and then set down. They are not unfeeling, they simply live at a different tempo, and the urgency of shorter lives can seem noisy against their long chords.

Hair grows as leaves, petals, and small blossoms, often braided into crownlets or combed into long canopies that rustle when the wind turns. Eyes are moss green and catch moonlight with a soft shine. Limbs are long, fingers end in thorn tips that can scratch stone and carve soft wood, and their balance lives somewhere between playful dancer and patient briar. Clothing is light and layered, woven from flax and barkcloth, trimmed in seed beads and pressed flowers, meant to breathe with the body rather than bind it. An Elnar at ease hums with the slow rhythm of sap and stream, an Elnar roused moves with sudden whip quick precision, like a branch snapping back to shape.\nCulture: Elnars join the world as participants, not rulers, and their homes are the spaces between roots and river stones, the meadows that shift each year, the groves that remember old fires and new rains. Communities form in bands that follow seasons, spring gatherings in bloom filled clearings, summer circuits along reed beds and bee trails, autumn feasts under lantern gourds, winter vigils where snow thickens the sound. Work is play when done in chorus, stories traded by mimicry and music, pranks teach patience, jokes test pride, art blooms and is allowed to fade. They rarely build rigid towns, they tend living places and mark paths with song lines and wind chimes. Outsiders may mistake this for carelessness, yet Elnars keep fierce loyalties, step between axe and sapling without hesitation, and answer insults with cunning, leading trespassers into dead end thickets, unweaving their plans with misdirection until folly binds them. Leadership is a garden, voices that charm and heal are followed until a new song rises. Ritual dance and call and response drumming carry decisions, and those who learn the rhythm are welcomed, laughter first, lessons after.\nOther:\n\nBarkskin: When not wearing armor, your skin counts as light armor, AC equals 12 + DEX.\nThorn Nails: Your unarmed strikes can deal 1d4 piercing damage.\nSeasonal Veil: You have advantage on Stealth checks made in natural environments.\nVerdant Stride: Nonmagical undergrowth does not count as difficult terrain for you, and you have advantage on Climbing checks made on living trees or vines.\n\nPositive Affinities: Creation, Generic, Water, Air, Physical\nNeutral Affinities: Earth\nNegative Affinities: Fire, Craft, Utility\nBonuses: +3 CON, +1 STR, +2 CHAR"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Ferramite":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Ferramite","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Humanoid Races/Ferramite.md","title":"Ferramite","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 5’0 - 6’4\nWeight: 200 - 300 lbs\nLifespan: 80 - 100\nSize: Medium\nSpeed: 30 ft\nLanguage: Common, Dwarvish\nDescription: Ferramites look like living suits of armor, bodies cast in interlocking plates that flex along hidden seams. Their skin gleams with a metallic sheen, from dull iron and weathered bronze to mirror bright chrome, and beneath those plates run filaments of luminous energy that pulse around the face, joints, and breastplate. Limbs are long and lever strong, hands end in jointed, claw like fingers that click softly when they open and close. There is no hair, only the clean lines of forged metal and the glow of gemstone eyes, multifaceted and shifting color with mood or elemental exposure. Even at rest they hold themselves like statues, balanced and ready, and when they move it is with deliberate power, steps that feel like hammer strikes setting a rhythm through the ground. Clothing is spare and functional, belts and bindings over plate, ritual sashes for duels, engraved badges that record trials endured. A Ferramite’s voice carries a resonant timbre, quiet until a challenge is answered, then firm enough to still a room.\nCulture: To a Ferramite, combat is not cruelty, it is a language that tells the truth of who you are. They grow up in training halls and open arenas, places where movement is studied like scripture and contests are witnessed like vows. Every bout is consented to, every duel has a herald and a judge, and cheating is a shame that can end a name. Children learn to fight before they learn to write, drills interlaced with lessons on restraint, mercy, and control. Strength is not a license to dominate, it is an obligation to protect, and the greatest respect is shown to those who can pull a strike one finger’s breadth from a rival’s throat. Outside their homeland they are mistaken for brutes, but Ferramites take pains to ensure force is a shield, not a cudgel. They prefer clear rules, recorded trials, and rites that leave both sides stronger. Status is earned through ordeals of endurance, precision, and will, and a life story is measured in witnesses, the elders who say they saw you stand, yield, learn, and return ready to be better.\nOther:\n\nMetalline Frame: Your natural armor sets your AC to 14 + CON mod + DEX mod while you are not wearing armor.\nEmber Veins: You have resistance to fire damage.\nHardened Plating: You have resistance to slashing and piercing damage from non magical sources.\nLattice Claws: Your claws are natural weapons that deal 1d6 slashing damage, they count as one handed melee weapons.\nFurnace Sight: You have darkvision out to 60 ft.\nRite of Challenge: Once per short rest, as a bonus action you may declare a duel against a creature you can see within 30 ft.

Muscle sits on muscle, a body shaped by scale and endurance rather than training, hair sparse or absent, faces stretched and squared by a larger geometry. Every step lands with felt weight, every small motion carries leverage that would topple a cart if carelessly placed. Voices roll like distant thunder and hold a patient cadence, the rhythm of long lives measured in storms and stonefalls. However simple their silhouettes may seem, their eyes hold an old vitality, a steadiness that comes from standing through centuries of weather, war, and want. They wear what lasts, hide and chain, slabs of woven cloth, iron rings hammered to fit knuckles the size of bricks, trophies that clang when they laugh.\nCulture: Giants live for the clash, not out of hatred but because fighting feels right in their bones. They wrestle for courtship, arm-crack for wagers, and settle arguments with bouts called on the spot, a circle of stones, a few shouted rules, and a crowd that loves a clean hit. Plans longer than a day make their heads hurt, so they favor simple truths, eat when hungry, sleep when tired, fight when challenged, help kin when called. They admire raw strength, loud courage, and a good joke, and they measure respect in bruises traded without whining. Giants are blunt to the point of rudeness, bad at lying, worse at scheming, and proud of it. They hoist trophies because they are shiny or heavy, not because they are rare, and they tell stories with their scars more than their words. Toward smaller folk they are boisterously tolerant, calling them “little cousins,” teasing them, lifting them out of harm’s way with one hand, and forgetting that doors and roofs break under giant fingers. Their few laws are easy to remember, speak plainly, keep your promises, don’t strike the weak unless they ask for it, laugh after the bout, and share the stew.\nOther:\n\nVeilborn Endurance: You are resistant to poison, cold, and heat damage.\nMountain’s Reserve: You still gain exhaustion levels, but the effects of levels 1 through 3 do not apply to you.

Their eyes are light-touched, pale amber or milk-gold, and catch faint glints in the dark. Movements are loose and unhurried, like a person walking through a daydream, then suddenly precise when they decide to act. Their clothes favor soft fabrics, light colors, and simple cuts that do not snag when slipping through tight spaces. Most wear thin gloves or wraps to avoid leaving prints when they phase through walls, an old habit that sticks even when unnecessary.\nCulture: There is no single homeland. Halofade drift toward big trade roads and cities, places with doors to slip past and crowds to disappear into. They work as couriers, “retrieval specialists”, messengers who never miss a meeting, and scouts who can get eyes anywhere. They are casual about belonging, small flats, borrowed rooms, and rooftop camps are common, and friendships are loose circles built on favors and easy company. They respect quiet competence, clean getaways, and promises kept exactly as spoken. If a Halofade says they will be there, they will be there.\nOther:\n\nFade Step, misalignment: As a bonus action, you become intangible until the start of your next turn.

You cannot take this action more than once every 5 turns. \nAnchor Link, swap: As an action, choose a creature or object you can see within 60 ft and place a link on it for 1 minute.

You may only create one link per short rest but can swap as many times as you wish while the link exists. \nPhoton Lance: As an action, make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within 300 ft. This attack ignores all cover and has a +5 to hit (as well as your Generic Affinity and Magical Acc). On a hit, the target takes 1d4 Radiant damage. The damage increases by 1d4 every 4 Total Level.

Ten humans can stand shoulder to shoulder, each with different skin, hair, scars, posture, and still read as a single kind. Their bodies run the full spread from wiry to broad, their faces carry countless small adaptations to sun, wind, salt, dust, city soot. They cut hair short or wear it long, bind it in cloth or bronze, paint it with ash or oil, and change styles as quickly as seasons turn. Their movements are purposeful when work demands, loose when the day is won, quick to learn new tools, quicker to misuse them into new ones. Human eyes do not glow or shift like some races’, but they hold a stubborn spark that refuses to dim, and when a human decides to keep going, they usually do, even if it means limping, crawling, or laughing while they bleed. Their clothing tells their story, stitched patches, repurposed finds, a festival sash next to a soldier’s buckle, a traveler’s coat lined with notes and maps in the margins.\nCulture: Human culture is a thousand overlapping arguments with the world about how to live. River towns teach trade and ferries, dune villages prize water lore and patience, cliff cities love stone and echoing songs, road camps pass news faster than couriers. Some nations raise scholars and engineers, others drill militias, others still grow artists by accident because the streets keep telling stories. Faiths, guilds, clans, and crews braid into identities that change with place and luck. What most humans share is urgency and reach, they will try anything twice, they will steal good ideas and make them work with spare parts, and they will turn a setback into a plan before the dust settles. They argue loudly, forgive slowly, and rally fast under a banner if the reason feels right. In mixed companies, humans often end up as translators between mindsets, the person who says “we can try it” while already tying a rope and checking the wind.\nOther:\n\nIndomitable Will: When you are reduced to 0 hp you have 1 hp instead once per combat.\nVersatile Talent: You gain +1 skill points per level\nRally: Once per short rest, as a bonus action, choose one ally within 30 ft who can see or hear you.

In moonlight their bodies pick up faint frostwork, hair lies white as driven snow or the blue of glacier light, and eyes run pale blue to silver with a depth that feels winter quiet. Their builds favor endurance over flash, backs straight, lungs deep, and a measured strength that shows only when needed. Movements are controlled and soft, like snowfall masking a storm, steps set without crunch, hands steady even in bitter wind. Lines of the face are spare, the mouth kept still until speech serves purpose. Their clothing layers wool, fur, and sealant leathers into simple silhouettes that hold heat without weight, belts carry runic slates and etched bone charms, and travel packs are packed with care, a place for everything and nothing wasted. When Iceborn stand watch, they do it as if time were another kind of weather to outlast, quiet, observant, and ready to spend themselves for others.\nCulture: Iceborn communities practice warmth inside walls and austerity outside them. Aid comes first, pride after, and no one eats until everyone is found. They believe suffering is expected, not celebrated, and strength is the habit of carrying it without complaint. Leadership looks like guidance, elder runepriests and elemental scholars teaching more than ordering, and disputes cool under ritual before they flare. Their sacred language, Serinite, is studied as scripture and tool, each rune both a word and a prayer, a frost line scratched into the bones of the world. Children learn to breathe slow, to bank their fires, to carve patience into their days. They speak when needed and trust that action explains more clearly than argument. Outsiders often mistake silence for coldness, but within an Iceborn hall the hearth is open, the ledger of help is long, and debts are paid forward. Their heroes are those who endured without spectacle and those who spent their strength quietly so others did not have to.\nOther:\n\nFrostbound Flesh: You are immune to cold damage.\nWinter Tempered: You have resistance to fire damage, and you have advantage on checks and saving throws made to resist environmental heat, dehydration, and wind.\nSnow Tread: Snow and ice do not count as difficult terrain for you.

Hair tends to be coarse and dark, the ends sometimes smoldering after exertion, and eyes burn a steady orange that never quite looks natural. The air around them wavers in faint mirage ripples, and cloth worn too long scorches at collars and cuffs. Veins glow when their emotions spike or mana surges, etching slow, molten lines along the neck and forearms. Their movements are measured rather than frantic, like banked coals that can flash to white heat in an instant. Voices are low and even, carrying a dry rasp, and the scent of warm stone or smoke clings to them after any fight or spellcasting.\nCulture: Ignites are a people defined by restraint and ritual. They dwell in the Ember Wastes where obsidian ridges, glass dunes, and lava vents dictate travel, shelter, and trade. Each person bears a Core Spark, a sacred metaphor for self-mastery, and most rites revolve around controlling, not flaunting, power. Duels are tests of patience more than fury, and apprentices learn to build a fire that lasts the night before they are trusted to cast openly. Outsiders often mistake their silence for hostility, yet the Ignite ethic is simple: act only with purpose, burn only what must be burned, protect the flame that protects you. They rarely campaign, build empires, or proselytize, preferring compact domes of fused glass, shifting camps over warm stone, and pilgrimage routes that follow seasonal heat. Leaving the Wastes is uncommon and risky; even the strongest quickly learn the world beyond is not built for bodies that run hot. When Ignites do travel, they serve as purifiers, ruin-scouts, plague-burners, and wardens against creeping corruption, returning home to recite long, spare accounts of what was cleansed and why.\nOther:\n\nFireborn Physiology: You are immune to heat and fire damage, and vulnerable to cold damage.\nHeat Dependence: If you remain in environments under 70°F for more than 1 hour, you gain 1 level of exhaustion per day.

Their eyes are narrow and often gold or yellow, and their posture is naturally upright and militaristic. Kravari often wear segmented armor and keep their hair cropped or styled into battle crests. They have small tusks protruding from their lower jaw and subtle claws instead of fingernails.\nCulture: The Kravari live in structured, highly disciplined societies. Every Kravari is taught combat strategy, survival, and rhetoric from youth. They value order, precision, and honor in service, and they prize intellect just as highly as strength. Kravari warbands often function more like mobile cities than raiding parties, with engineers, philosophers, and tacticians among their ranks. While often mistrusted due to their aggressive appearance and conquest based history, Kravari can be fiercely loyal allies.

Complexions range from sun-bronze to moonlit pearl, always with a soft sheen like light resting just beneath the surface. Their eyes are fully colored in whites, silvers, golds, or ambers, still yet shimmering, and hair runs from pure white through warm yellow to faint rose, most often worn long and unbound so it can catch and scatter light. In motion they appear curated rather than casual, shoulders square, steps light, and speech measured, as though public grace were a daily discipline. Even at rest there is an awareness about them, the sense that they place themselves where light would show them best.\nCulture: To the Lumari, light is principle as much as element. They build cities around crystal towers that seize and refract the sun, and their rites set dawn and high noon as sacred hours. Illumination is a moral act: to reveal truth, to cleanse, to connect the seen world to what lies above it. Clarity, honesty, and purposeful living are the virtues most often taught; deception is a failure of character, mercy a form of guidance. These ideals can harden into rigor when unexamined, and Lumari sometimes mistake personal conviction for rightful authority. Many serve as scholars, judges, priests, healers, or keepers of radiant rune-magic passed through scripture and lineage. Hospitality is real but formal, and their distance can feel like pride to quicker, rougher cultures. Their preferred leadership is by example, lives tuned to steadiness and care so others can step into the light without being forced.\nOther:\n\nLumen Aura: You emit dim light in a 5-ft radius at all times.

In their native Nyxrealm—the lightless echo of the material world—their bodies ride the edges of form like smoke pinned to a shape. In the mortal world they appear as the outline of a person with luminous eyes that float in the darkness of their face, and the air seems to dim around them as if light forgets to fully arrive. Their contours ripple when they move, a hush of not-quite-sound tracking each step.

In the world of light they cannot directly harm or touch, so their pranks are distractions, swapped signs, stolen echoes of footsteps—yet in the Nyxrealm they are hunters and wardens. Bands of Nyctaris gather where shadows pool deepest, mirroring streets and forests that exist above, building quiet courts where disputes are settled by cleverness rather than cruelty. They value subtlety, patience, and the craft of disappearing at the perfect moment. Outsiders often meet them as tricksters, but beneath the teasing is a hard rule: power must be paid for with risk. To harm another truly, a Nyctaris must cross fully into danger, and most reserve that choice for tyrants and oath-breakers.\nOther:\n\nUmbral Sight: Darkvision up to 150 ft.

Faces are sharp and lean, canines a touch long, and nails grow as subtle claws that mark bark and catch stone. Bodies are corded rather than bulky, built for distance on rough ground and violent bursts when the choice is fight or flee. They dress in what the land gives, leathers, woven grasses, bone toggles, and feathers, each piece keeping a small story, a hunt, a storm, a crossing. Movement is quiet and economical, heads tilting to listen before they speak, hands reading wind and soil without thinking. They smell like rain and woodsmoke, and when they smile it is quick, the way a fox shows teeth then vanishes into brush.\nCulture: Freedom sits at the center of an Opkathian life. They do not raise walls or write laws, they keep to trails that change with water and season, gathering in small bands or traveling alone when the spirit asks for silence. Hierarchy feels like a trap to them, so authority is temporary and earned by the moment, the hunter who knows the river leads at the river, the runner who knows the ridge leads at the ridge. Days fill with hunting, foraging, trading paths, and long watches under open sky. Loyalty is real but slow to form, a bond is proven by miles and winters, not by oaths spoken in a hall. They respect life but do not fear violence, when pressed they end a threat fast and without ceremony. Their creed is simple, choose your own way, answer your instincts, take nothing that cannot be carried or paid back, leave a place no worse than you found it.\nOther:\n\nBeast Tongue: You can communicate simple emotions and intent with beasts, and you understand theirs in return. This does not grant full speech, only strong emotions such as fear, trust, hunger, or curiosity come through clearly.\nWild Step: After taking the Dash Action you are immune to the effects of difficult terrain.\nFeral Claws: Your unarmed strikes can deal 1d4 slashing damage.\nUnbound: You have advantage on checks and saving throws to resist being grappled or restrained.\n\nSubraces\nGreen\nSmaller, quicker, bright or mossy green skin, attention tilted toward the quiet of magic.\n\nBonuses: +2 WIS, +1 DEX\nGrove Attunement: Your Base Acc with magical attacks increases by +1.\nLeaffall: Reduce falling distance by 10 ft when calculating fall damage.\n\nBrown\nTaller, heavier, bark brown to dark soil skin, built to meet force and keep moving.\n\nBonuses: +2 STR, +1 CON\nRooted Stance: You have advantage on checks to resist being shoved or grappled.\nBreaker Rush: Once per turn, if you move at least 20 ft straight toward a creature and hit it with a melee attack, add +1d4 base melee damage to that attack.\n\nPositive Affinities: Air, Water, Earth\nNeutral Affinities: Generic, Fire\nNegative Affinities: Physical, Craft, Creation, Utility\nBonuses: +2 CHAR, -1 INT"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Sandmen":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Sandmen","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Humanoid Races/Sandmen.md","title":"Sandmen","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 5’6 - 6’8\nWeight: 120 - 210 lbs\nLifespan: 140 - 220 years\nSize: Medium\nSpeed: 30 ft\nLanguage: Common\nDescription: Sandmen are psionic dream-walkers. Their skin runs pale sand to ash-blue; eyes are milky or pearl-black with thin vertical pupils. Fingers are long and cool to the touch. Across the lineage there are clear variants: some look almost human with faint facial ridges and smooth scalps; others bear short cranial tendrils and soft, split palates; the most cephalid have small prehensile facial tendrils and a flexible, cartilaginous jaw. Their movements are quiet and economical, and they react to sound and scent as if “reading” the room. Tools favor clean lines and padded grips for long study sessions; armor is close-fit and unadorned.\nCulture: Sandman have no unified nation or creed. Most Sandmen live scattered through big cities where crowds and constant sleep make work easy. They hire out as information brokers, interrogators, wardens of the rich (ending nightmares), or mercenaries who “solve” problems in the dead of night. They prefer leverage over loyalty and keep rotating safehouses, false names, and clean paper trails. Cooperation is temporary; if a cell forms, it’s for a job, not a tribe.\nOther:\n\nDream Entry (1/Short Rest): As an Action, target a sleeping or unconscious creature within 30 ft that you can see.

Skin is dense gray, matte in bright light, almost stone polished in low light. Eyes are bulbous and mirror dark, adapted to drink detail from gloom. Their scalps carry ridges from brow to nape like carved strakes, ears lie tight to the skull, noses stay flat and practical. Hands are thick fingered with chisel like nails, palms calloused where tools kick and vibrate. They move with an efficient, mechanical grace, steps placed to waste nothing, shoulders and elbows angling to keep leverage clean. Dress is function first, layered work leathers, reinforced aprons, utility belts heavy with bit sets, calipers, and greasecloths, and many integrate small mechanical assists into armor plates, spring braces at knees or shock straps at wrists.\nCulture: Snerin build deep and think deeper. They favor volcanic tunnels, obsidian seams, and ruin strata where the world’s heat and pressure can be measured and used. Communities are insulated, not cruel, but cautious, the surface and its changeable peoples are variables to be contained. Value is proved in blueprints that hold, machines that start every time, tools that outlive their makers. Songs carry memory, long work chants and epics timed to the stroke rate of hammers and drills, each verse encoding a caution or a fix. Outsiders are tolerated at arm’s length, every claim weighed against tested logic, every bargain checked twice. To a Snerin, worth is what you leave behind, useful, beautiful, and enduring. Magic is a means, woven into instruments and rigs, never flash when a fixture will do.\nOther:\n\nUmbral Optics: You see normally in complete darkness out to 60 ft (This is not darkvision, you can see in full color).\nLightshock: When you enter bright light from dim light or darkness, make a CON save, DC 12 + Proficiency Bonus + CON mod.

Skin runs to muddy greens, dusty browns, or sallow yellows, faces are round and hyper expressive, and hair sprouts in wild shocks that ignore combs. They move with a jittery, corner of the eye speed, voices piped and quick, and even at rest their muscles seem held like a coiled spring. The world often reads them as pests, but their twitchy stares hide sharp, situational cunning.\nCulture: Spritelings do not gather by bloodline or tribe, they attach themselves to bigger, louder centers of gravity. They glom onto strong personalities for protection, power, or amusement, mimicking habits and crowning themselves second in command the moment it feels safe. In many towns they are nuisances, in others they are employed as runners, spies, or tireless hands. Fertile and opportunistic, they appear anywhere a niche opens, from tower rafters to kitchen alleys. Individually fragile and often underestimated, in numbers they can turn mischief into leverage and chaos into a plan.\nOther:\n\nSkitter Dodge: When you are within 10 ft of a creature larger than you, you may Dash or Hide as a free action.\nUnderfoot Escape: When a Medium or larger creature misses you with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to move up to 5 ft to an unoccupied space. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.\nFurry of the Small: Each time you succeed in making an attack on a creature you get +1 to all damage done in subsequent attacks to that same creature.

Their faces hold the beauty of statues left out in the rain, smooth features thinned by worry, lips pale, cheeks a touch sunken. Hair falls in limp strands of silver, white, or faded black, rarely styled beyond a loose tie, as if any extra effort would cost too much. Every motion comes slow and deliberate, shoulders settling before they move, fingers hovering over a task for a heartbeat as if deciding whether it is worth doing. Rooms feel quieter when a Sylphmare enters, not colder in temperature, but hushed, the way a house sounds after bad news. Their clothes favor muted cloth, threadbare coats and long wraps that hang like tired shadows, charms of bone or dull glass stitched on more out of ritual than pride. They look like they have just woken from a nightmare, or never quite left it, carrying its weight in their posture and in the way their eyes flick to the darkest corner first.\nCulture: Sylphmare settlements are thin on the map, a scattering of wayhouses and grottoes where silence is law and lanterns are shaded. Most live alone or in very small circles, speaking rarely, sharing what they have without ceremony. From childhood they are taught that life is short and heavy, that endurance is a craft made of small choices, eat a little, rest a little, help when you can. Joy does not come easily, so they do not chase it, instead they practice honesty, plain words, and a refusal to promise what they cannot give. Art exists, but it is spare and piercing, poems like open windows on winter nights, songs that do not rise above a murmur, carvings that leave more stone untouched than cut. Magic turns inward, illusions and mind shaping used to show others what despair looks like from the inside, not to frighten, but to make truth visible. Outsiders pity them, or fear them, or try to fix them, none of which a Sylphmare asks for. What they value is presence, someone who will sit the watch through a long night, say what is real, and leave when the dawn finally shows. When they do fight, they fight like people who have made peace with loss, steady, tireless, and without bluff.\nOther:\n\nNightglass Sight: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft, and dim light does not impose penalties on your Spot checks.\nGloomborne Resilience: You have resistance to all non magical damage.\nSleepwalker’s Mind: You are immune to sleep and fear effects.\nBleak Aura: All creatures (including allies) within 15 ft of you have disadvantage on attack rolls.\nQuiet Step: You gain expertise in stealth.\nDimming Touch: As an action, you can extinguish non magical light sources within 10 ft that are no larger than a torch or lantern.\n\nPositive Affinities:\nNeutral Affinities:\nNegative Affinities: Generic, Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Physical, Craft, Creation, Utility\nBonuses: -2 STR, -2 CON, -2 DEX, -2 WIS, -2 INT, +2 CHA"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Varkun":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Varkun","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Humanoid Races/Varkun.md","title":"Varkun","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 5’0 - 6’5\nWeight: 130 - 270 lbs\nLifespan: 60 - 120 years\nSize: Medium\nSpeed: 30 ft\nLanguage: Common, Ignan\nDescription: Varkun are infernally touched and unmistakable at a glance. Skin runs deep red, burnt copper, or slate gray, and heat seems to pool beneath it in faint, ember like motes that brighten with anger or spellwork. Thick, curling horns rise from the brow, each set uniquely banded, ridged, or swept, some etched with sigils, some heavy with rings, others left raw as a statement of will. A long, muscular tail balances every step and telegraphs mood by lash or slow coil. Eyes glow from within, molten golds and crimsons steady as banked coals, and in moments of stress a thin smoke threads from shoulders and jaw. Their frames are lean and tendoned rather than bulky, built for hard streets, quick climbs, and the kind of stillness that precedes a decisive move. Clothes favor layered leathers and metal trims that take heat without warping, pockets for chalk and coin, blades worn close to the ribs, and a single clean symbol of clan cut where it will not be missed.\nCulture: Varkun history is written at the edges of other peoples’ cities, in alleys, border forts, caravan yards, and markets that forget names as easily as they take coin. Mistrusted for their bloodlines and blamed for fires they did not start, they learned to survive by reading rooms quickly, by building clans that hold tighter than law, and by turning reputation into armor. Within an enclave, loyalty is currency and promise, any Varkun will lie, fight, or vanish for kin, and betrayal is answered in ritual, names struck from ledgers, marks burned cold. Leadership is earned by competence, not birth, the planner who keeps a crew fed leads until someone better proves it. Children are taught three crafts, one to eat, one to escape, one to rise, and the wise keep two lives, one that smiles in daylight and one that moves at the hour when debts are paid. Many hire on as mercenaries, warders, fixers, or brokers, others dive into arcane study to master the fires that cling to their bones. They are not saints, they are not devils, they are pragmatic, proud, and tired of being hunted, and when a Varkun gives their word under witness, they keep it, because a broken oath is a clan’s shame.\nOther:\n\nFireblood Resilience: You have resistance to fire damage.\nHeat Mirage: The air around you shimmers with heat. Adjacent enemies have -1 Base Acc on attack rolls against you.\nHorned Rush: You have a natural horn attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. If you move at least 10 ft straight toward a target before hitting with this attack, add +1d4 base melee damage to that attack.\nTail Balance: Your tail aids balance and quick movement. You have advantage on Acrobatics checks to keep footing, cross narrow surfaces, or avoid falling.

Skin comes in earthen tones, clay, charcoal, red brick, with a coarse, grit worn texture that shrugs off scrapes. They stand just below the human average, yet wide frames, blocky shoulders, and broad hands make them read larger, the way a loaded cart takes more space than its wheels suggest. Faces are plain and square, eyes set under heavy brows, noses blunt, beards thick where they grow, often clipped short to keep out of gears and grit. Movements are stiff and purposeful, elbows tucked, feet planted heel to toe, a practical economy that feels more like machinery in motion than dance. Everything about them hints at endurance, palms leathered where handles sit, nails squared like tools, breath slow and steady even under weight.\nCulture: For a Zephar, life is work, not as punishment, as proof. They measure worth in repetitions endured, in spans of wall raised, in tons moved before the bell. Settlements lie low and wide, dormitory halls with row bunks and shared benches, a bathhouse that runs on a strict schedule, a bell that marks shifts, a foreman by consent rather than decree. Craft for its own beauty does not move them, they will polish a surface only so it will not catch, they will etch a line only so a measurement can be read at a glance. Speech is clipped, sentences welded from few words, and metaphor feels like sand in a bearing, they would rather show a jig than explain a poem. Outsiders often mistake this for coldness, yet Zephar bind tightly to those who show up, day after day, through rain and grit, friendships earned by shared loads rather than shared stories. They distrust grand plans and flashy magic, prefer fixtures to firelight, prefer a tested lever to a promise, and though they rarely boast, they quietly outlast most rivals.\nOther:\n\nGrind Through: You gain levels of exhaustion at half the normal rate.\nDeepvision: You can see normally in complete darkness out to 60 ft.\nAnchor Stance: You have advantage on checks and saving throws to resist being shoved, knocked prone, or forcibly moved.\nWork Rhythm: If you repeat the same action on two consecutive turns, on the second turn you gain +1 Base Acc or +1 Base Damage on one attack from that action, choose when you make the attack.\n\nPositive Affinities: Fire, Earth, Craft, Creation, Utility\nNeutral Affinities: Generic, Physical\nNegative Affinities: Water, Air\nBonuses: +2 STR, +1 CON, -2 INT"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Zontian":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Humanoid-Races/Zontian","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Humanoid Races/Zontian.md","title":"Zontian","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 5’0 - 6’0\nWeight: 130 - 190 lbs\nLifespan: 90 - 140 years\nSize: Medium\nSpeed: 30 ft\nLanguage: Common\nDescription: Zontians are graceful humanoids whose skin runs from deep charcoal to soft silver, often contrasted by hair of pure white or a muted metallic sheen. Their eyes hold a faint inner light, pale blue, gold, or lavender, and the glow never quite leaves even in shadow. Features are symmetrical and fine cut without fragility, posture measured, and movement deliberate, like a ceremony learned by heart. Their clothing favors natural symbols and beadwork, dyed fabrics that echo river, leaf, and sky, worn with quiet confidence rather than show. A Zontian’s presence reads as steadying, the feeling that voices should lower and haste should pause. They listen before they speak, weigh before they answer, and when they act it is with the calm precision of someone who treats each choice as part of a larger pattern.\nCulture: Zontian life is woven from ritual, harmony, and service. They see themselves as one strand in the balance of land and spirit, keepers rather than rulers, and they measure worth by how well a person steadies the world around them. Hierarchy is gentle and earned, elders guide because they have proven wisdom and a habit of care, not because they grasp for rank. Song, chant, and ceremonial dance carry teaching and law, turning daily work into practiced rites that bind households and villages together. Travel does not shake their customs, Zontians preserve their forms even far from home, believing tradition is an anchor against corruption and chaos. Outsiders seek them for counsel in disputes, for healing in grief, and for judgment when the line between wrong and harm blurs. They can be stern with those who scorn the living world, yet they keep their admonitions clean and specific, correct the deed, guard the bond, and move on. Rare pale skinned Zontians are revered as signs of enlightenment, but in practice they eat at the same tables and labor in the same circles as all others, honor is expressed as duty shared.\nOther:\n\nMoonlit Sight: You can see normally in darkness out to 60 ft.\nAccrual of Grace: You gain +2 Affinity Points each time you gain a class level, regardless of class.\nTranquil Resolve: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

Faces carry heavy brows, deep set eyes, and upward curving lower tusks that show when they bare their teeth. Arms hang long and powerful, giving them a looming, predatory posture even at rest. They are not as massively built as Grull, but what they lack in raw bulk they replace with calculation, scanning every room for leverage, every person for weakness. Tusks click when they think, fingers drum on hafts and rails, and their gaze weighs others as tool or threat. Dress is practical and hard wearing, reinforced leathers and chain where blows land, trophy cords and rank marks kept where they will be seen first.\nCulture: Boaf organize around dominance and function. Authority is earned by intimidation, planning, and the ability to keep a line from breaking under pressure. Crews mix muscle and mind, a Boaf leader will drive Tull, Grull, or any hireling into a pattern that serves the objective, and waste is treated as failure. Loyalty is transactional, kept so long as the ledger balances, and every bond is tested by usefulness. They train for battlefield control more than spectacle, channeling enemies into kill lanes, breaking nerve with timed shouts and shows of force, ordering allies to strike where impact will ripple. They hoard favors and secrets, punish betrayal without pause, and replace fallen pieces quickly. Trust is rare, respect is measurable, and a Boaf who promises protection expects tribute, information, or obedience in return. Their stories praise victories won by pressure and positioning as much as by strength, and a quiet commander who never loses is prized above a loud one who wins big and bleeds the team.\nOther:\n\nDarkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.\nIron Will: You have advantage on saving throws against the charmed condition and on Charisma saving throws.\nIntimidation Mastery: You have double advantage on Intimidation checks, and you may use STR instead of CHA for Intimidation.\nTyrant’s Pulse: As a bonus action, release an intimidating kinetic surge.

Broad shoulders carry a thick, feline spine that coils before it strikes, and long forearms end in heavy, clawed hands built to haul, rend, and climb. Faces blend bear bulk with great cat lines, wide muzzles, heavy jaws, and tusks that curl from the lower jaw. Eyes burn amber or green and track like predators, measuring distance, footing, and nerve. Despite their size they move with explosive grace, a low lunge into a sudden snap of speed, and even their stillness feels wound for motion. Harness and clothing are simple and battle sure, reinforced straps over chest and hips, trophies tied where they will swing in rhythm with a charge.\nCulture: Brogath live by tests you can see. Status is earned in rings, on hunts, and at the front of lines, not inherited. A dispute becomes a duel, a boast becomes a trial, and a leader holds the place until someone proves stronger, smarter, or steadier. Aggression sits inside a clean code: never betray your clutch, never strike from behind in a challenge, take losses as lessons, and carry your own weight. Loyalty within a clutch is absolute and practical, everyone trains, everyone scouts, everyone shares, and cowardice is remembered. They value trophies only when they prove a worthy risk, stories only when they teach courage, and plans only when they sharpen the strike. Outsiders are tested rather than welcomed, but a stranger who stands a bout, pulls a load, and keeps a promise can earn a place at the fire.\nOther:\n\nDarkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.\nNatural Claws: Your claws are natural weapons that deal 1d6 slashing damage.

Their frames are dense with working muscle; skin tones run slate-gray to sun-baked tan, often scarred from quarry work and siege labor. Hair is coarse and usually braided back from the brow to keep the eye clear. Their lone pupil is large and steady, giving them an unblinking, intimidating stare. Tools and weapons are oversized, stone mauls, iron hooks, and throw-stones the size of a man’s head. Armor is plate-and-hide, strapped to leave the eye and shoulders free to rotate without snagging.\nCulture: Most Cyclops clans live in cliffholds near quarries or lava-cut canyons where stone and ore are close at hand. They value direct work and direct speech: if something needs doing, lift it; if a promise is made, keep it. Leadership is simple, whoever solves the biggest problems earns the right to speak first. Clans keep tallies: bridges raised, walls broken, caravans hauled over mountain passes. Outsiders hire Cyclopes as haulers, breakers, and siege-engine crews; payment is counted in metal, salt, and stonecutting rights. While they can be solitary, they travel in work-parties for big jobs, pairing a spotter with each thrower and a lifter with each chiseler. Feuds start over blocked water or stolen stone; they end when someone moves the boulder or returns it. Subtlety is not prized, reliability is.\nOther:\n\nMonocular Focus: You have advantage on saving throws against visual illusions and effects that impose disadvantage due to visual misdirection (e.g., mirror images, blurs, glamours) however you gain disadvantage on all other perception based checks.\nDepth Blind Spot: You have disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks beyond 30 ft (does not affect thrown boulders granted by this race).\nBoulder Toss (1/Short Rest): As an Action, hurl a quarry stone to 60/120 ft; on a hit, the target takes 2d8 bludgeoning (counts as a Heavy thrown weapon you are proficient with).\nSiege-Born: You deal double damage to objects and structures, and you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to shove or break doors, gates, or barricades.\n\nPositive Affinities: Earth, Physical, Craft\nNeutral Affinities: Fire, Generic\nNegative Affinities: Air, Water, Utility\nBonuses: +4 STR, +2 CON, −2 DEX, −1 INT"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Galdrani":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Galdrani","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Monstrous Races/Galdrani.md","title":"Galdrani","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 7’0 - 9’0\nWeight: 280 - 450 lbs\nLifespan: 300 - 400 years\nSize: Large\nSpeed: 30 ft\nLanguage: Common, Elvish\nDescription: Galdrani are massive, moss cloaked humanoids whose long, drooping ears frame antler like horns that rise from the brow or crown. Skin runs bark brown to stone gray and carries living patches of lichen and shelf fungi along shoulders, spine, and hips. Their eyes hold a faint green glow, steady as lantern moss, and their voices resonate with a hollow timbre, like wind working through a canyon. For all their size they move quietly, weight set heel to toe with the care of a caretaker walking among roots. Robes and mantles are woven from vine, feather, and bone they have gathered and laid to rest, each piece a record of seasons watched and creatures honored. Hands are broad and steady, nails thick as bark, and when they stand still long enough the forest seems to reclaim them, a slow drift of leaf and spore settling on their shoulders until they move again.\nCulture: Galdrani keep to overlooked borders where wild and worked places touch. They hold that stones, waters, trees, and beasts all carry spirit, and they take stewardship as a daily craft rather than a title. They cultivate groves instead of cities, raise standing circles instead of walls, and set their laws in oaths of care, do no needless harm, restore what you use, bury what you break, teach what you learn. Decisions come slowly and deliberately, weighed against the long memory of land, and patience is mistaken for sloth by those who have never watched a hillside heal. They prefer to observe before they interfere, but once their boundary is crossed they answer with the certainty of weather, shaping ground, branch, and stone to turn aside those who will not listen. Stories are carried in quiet rites, funerals for animals they have lain in the earth, seed scatterings for cut clearings, and long walks taken without speech so the world can be heard properly.\nOther:\n\nStonebark Hide: While not wearing manufactured armor, your natural armor sets your AC to 13 + CON mod.\nRooted Titan: As a bonus action, you may root yourself in place until the start of your next turn.

Heavy muscles bunch under thick hide marked by ceremonial scars, many inlaid with metal ink or small gemstones that catch firelight like embers. Broad jaws carry outward tusks and the eyes glow faintly red or orange when anger or battle heat rises. Their kit favors flexible hides and strapped plates that leave shoulders and hips free, because they fight by moving, planting, and driving rather than standing still. Every Gorul reads like a line of force, feet set, hips square, hands ready to wrench, lift, and break.\nCulture: Gorul measure worth by what you carry through, not what you claim. Warbands bind by oath and deed rather than blood, ranks earned where work is hard, hunts are long, and lines are held. Strength means more than power alone, it means showing up on bad days, taking the load, standing where the push is worst, and doing it again tomorrow. Their songs are shouted accounts of those who did not yield, their shrines hold tools and shields that finished their work, and their leaders keep order by example first and scorn second. Raiding is a tactic, not an identity, and the same hands that break a gate will raise a wall before nightfall. Outsiders who mistake them for simple brutes learn quickly that Gorul are builders and hunters as well as fighters, patient with plans, swift with decisions, and stubborn with promises.\nOther:\n\nDarkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.\nTusks: Your tusks are natural weapons that deal 1d6 piercing damage.

Their features are sharp and impish, fingers and toes long and flexible for climbing, prying, and “repurposing” anything that was clearly doing nothing important. They rarely just walk, they skitter, hop, and crouch, always in motion as if their thoughts outrun their bodies. Clothing is patchwork and practical, stitched from scavenged scraps with hidden pockets, hook loops, and odd little devices that only make sense to the Grivlit who built them.\nCulture: Grivlit communities thrive in the margins, ruins, tunnel webs, ship graveyards, and tight forest warrens. They keep loose collectives instead of formal hierarchies, influence shifting to whoever has the smartest plan today. Settlements are assembled from salvage and logic only a Grivlit would follow, ladders that go nowhere until you need them, doors that open only when a weight is removed, bells that ring in a code of clicks and hisses. Improvisation is a virtue, the best plan is the one that shouldn’t have worked but did, and trust is tested by pranks and challenges more than by promises. Many become clever tinkerers, saboteurs, and wild alchemists, but just as many drift as agile opportunists who live on momentum and nerve.\nOther:\n\nShadowvision: You can see in darkness up to 20 ft.\nUnderfoot: You can move through the space of any creature Medium or larger.\nSlippery: You have advantage on checks and saving throws to escape a grapple, slip bindings, or squeeze through narrow gaps.\nLightfoot: The first 5 ft of nonmagical difficult terrain you enter each turn does not slow you.\n\nPositive Affinities: Craft, Utility, Air\nNeutral Affinities: Generic, Fire, Physical\nNegative Affinities: Water, Earth, Creation\nBonuses: +4 DEX, +1 INT, -3 STR, -3 CON"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Grull":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Grull","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Monstrous Races/Grull.md","title":"Grull","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 5’0 - 8’0\nWeight: 300 - 600 lbs\nLifespan: 40 - 60 years\nSize: Large\nSpeed: 30 ft\nLanguage: Common, Tullish\nDescription: Grull are massive, slab-muscled humanoids sheathed in leathery gray hide. Their torsos are barrel wide, shoulders knotted like anchors, and arms hang long and corded, built to smash gates, haul timbers, and tear plating from walls. Heavy jaws frame tusks that jut from the lower jaw, and thick brows throw their small, wary eyes into shadow. Everything about a Grull speaks of impact, stance sunk low, hips square, feet hitting the ground with hammer-weight certainty. Scars cross their chests and forearms in ridges, souvenirs of work as much as war. Gear is brutally practical, chain and studded leather where blows land, braced belts for carrying, and gauntlets wrapped to protect knuckles that do most of the arguing.\nCulture: Grull do not keep their own councils or cities; they are the muscle in someone else’s plan. Most live inside Tull nests or under hard-edged leaders who point and pay. Groups rarely hold more than one Grull, because dominance contests burn food and time. A Grull’s loyalty is a ledger of simple entries—meat, praise, a steady supply of things to break—and when the ledger runs dry, the Grull goes looking for a louder drum to follow. They ignore long speeches and strategy until the moment of impact; then instinct and repetition take over. In a line they are terrifyingly useful: they hold doors, carry shields that others hide behind, and end fights by deciding a wall should be somewhere else. Even so, they are not mindless. A Grull knows the value of fear, and their very presence often settles disputes before they start.\nOther:\n\nDarkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.\nBlunt Sorcery: You suffer −10 to Base Acc (magical) and −10 to Base Damage (magical).\nBrute Hide: You have resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from weapons wielded by creatures of Medium size or smaller.\nSiege Strength: You deal double damage to objects, structures, and fortifications.\nPowerful Build: You count as one size larger when determining the weight you can push, drag, or lift.\nSavage Swing: When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may push it up to 10 ft away from you.\n\nPositive Affinities: Physical, Craft, Creation, Utility\nNeutral Affinities: Earth\nNegative Affinities: Fire, Air, Water, Generic\nBonuses: +8 STR, +2 CON, -4 INT, -2 WIS, -5 CHA"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Harpy":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Harpy","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Monstrous Races/Harpy.md","title":"Harpy","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 5’0 - 6’5\nWeight: 80 - 140 lbs\nLifespan: 30 - 60 years\nSize: Medium\nSpeed: 25 ft (50 ft flying)\nLanguage: Aviari, Common\nDescription: Harpies are lean, bird-featured humanoids built for ambush. Shaggy feathers mantle the shoulders and spine; leathered wing-membranes stretch from the forearms to the flanks without limiting their clawed hands. Legs are digitigrade with hooked talons for perching or raking. Faces keep a rough human layout, but the teeth are sharp and the eyes are predatory. They smell of old meat and wind. Gear is whatever they can rip off victims, straps, bone toggles, and stolen knives, kept light enough to take flight at a moment’s notice.\nCulture: They flock in small cliffside nests and raid for anything they want. The plan is always simple: spot an isolated target, bait it closer with crude mimicry or obvious traps, then swarm, kill, and strip the body. They don’t haggle or honor deals. Rank is “who got the kill.” If patrols get wise, the flock relocates. They fight each other as easily as anyone else over food, shiny trinkets, or nesting spots. Harpies avoid difficult prey and attack the weak first; mercy isn’t in their vocabulary.\nOther:\n\nTalons (Natural Weapon): 1d6 slashing. When you hit a prone or grappled creature with Talons, add +1d4 slashing once per turn.\nCarrion Shriek (1/Short Rest): As an Action, emit a stunning screech in a 15-ft cone.

Corded muscle bunches beneath hide the color of old leather or dark mahogany, while a shag of mane runs from crown to shoulder. Horns are living heraldry, curved, ridged, or cleaver-straight, and many carve victories into them with scrimshawed sigils. Their muzzles breathe in hot, steady huffs; eyes glint with a patient, animal focus that can flip to charge-fury in a heartbeat. Armor is pragmatic and open-hipped to accommodate their quadriceps and tail sweep; favored weapons include long-hafted axes, tower-shields with corner spikes, and greatspears balanced for couching at a run. Underground, their hoofbeats echo like war-drums; in sunlit canyons, their silhouettes look like statues torn free to walk.\nCulture: Labyrinth law shapes Minotaur life. Their citadels are built as living mazes, spirals of habitation, work, and worship, so that every resident learns the hold by hoof and heartbeat. Elders teach “straight honesty in crooked halls”: hospitality to guests who respect the rules; swift, unflinching justice for oath-breakers. A Minotaur’s name is bound to their pathfinding prowess; children earn their adult cord by guiding an elder through a newly cut warren without hesitation. Craft traditions favor stone, bronze, and hammered iron; every stair is counted, every arch measured. Festivals are tests: riddle-runs in blindfold, strength trials in sand-rings, and the Great Quiet, an hour each new moon in which the entire hold falls silent to feel the maze “breathe.” Above all, they prize steadiness: better a slow truth than a fast lie, better a hard path than an easy betrayal.

Their bodies are translucent or pearly in blues and greens, rarely pink, with suspended whorls that flow when they move. Features are suggestions rather than fixed anatomy; a face can smooth into a mask, sprout brows, or widen its mouth as needed, and limbs thicken or taper to match a task. Tools and gear sit in harnesses and bands outside the body, since shape shifts would otherwise shear straps or warp buckles. When rushing, a Mireglopian tends to stream forward with a rolling, liquid stride, then collect itself into a tidy silhouette. Their voices are wet and resonant, like sound carried through water, and emotion reads in their color and opacity—anger darkens, calm clears, fear clouds.\nCulture: Mireglopian life is built around consent, fluidity, and refusal of confinement. They value self direction above tradition, and any rule that binds without choice is treated as harm. Communities organize as Pools, loose circles that form, split, and recombine as needs change. Decisions are made by “coalescence,” short gatherings where proposals are shaped until enough people can live with them; anyone who cannot simply flows to another Pool. Work favors roles that reward adaptability, scouting flooded tunnels, salvage, seal and gasket craft, and emergency medicine where hands must become wedges, clamps, or funnels. They teach their young two courtesies: take the shape a situation needs, and never demand that shape from another. Outsiders sometimes read this as selfishness; Mireglopians call it integrity. Bonds are real, but never coerced, and a promise is sacred precisely because it is freely chosen.\nOther:\n\nAmorphous Form: As a bonus action, you may reshape your body, altering limb placement, reach, or proportions.

You cannot be knocked prone.\nSlime Physiology: You have resistance to nonmagical slashing and nonmagical piercing damage, and immunity to nonmagical bludgeoning damage.

Every step they take radiates a readiness for violence. Even at rest, their movements are deliberate and predatory, like a big cat waiting to strike.\nCulture: The Naram-Sin live for the kill. Death is their purpose, not merely a means to survive. They hunt for the thrill of conquest, and their society is built around warbands led by the strongest and smartest among them. Leadership is not determined by brute strength alone, cunning and command of others are equally vital. Once a leader falls, the next strongest rises without hesitation, ensuring the warband’s purpose is never interrupted.

Scales run in tight plates over ropey muscle, usually yellow, red, or brown, with rare green lines in shaded regions. Eyes are wide and reflective, slitted for glare, and the snout vents thin threads of heat when they exert themselves. Hands and feet are long toed and gripping, built for sprinting over rock and scrambling up broken stone. Despite their size they hit fast and keep going; a Salamandrian can hold a run long after taller foes fold. Clothing stays light and fireproofed, with ash gray wraps and oiled leathers that won’t scorch. Their voices rasp like breath over coals, and when they laugh it comes as short puffs, more heat than humor.\nCulture: Fierce and relentless, Salamandrians sort the world into hunters, hazards, and heat. They crowd together in tight bands when the work is hard, break apart when tempers rise, and reform without apology around whoever has the clearest path to food and safety. Mean streaks are common and often aimed downward; anything not Salamandrian starts at the bottom and must earn space. Mercy is rare but not unknown, it tends to follow displays of stubborn courage. They cannot abide cold; band law centers on fires kept, routes between warm ground, and knowing exactly how far a body can push before chill takes the hands. Nights are for runs, long, steady, and silent, and many bands make their reputation by catching prey that thought darkness would save them. They prize endurance, fire craft, and the ability to read heat like others read maps.\nOther:\n\nFireborn: You are immune to Fire damage and to nonmagical environmental heat.\nCold Averse: You are vulnerable to Cold damage.

Fingers are slightly webbed, nails hard as shell, and hair drifts in the slightest breeze as if remembering the tide. Their voices carry a layered resonance that can ripple cups or still a tavern mid-chorus, and their pupils narrow to slits in bright daylight but widen into full, dark discs beneath the waves.

They stake out coves, river mouths, and shipping lanes, pick a target, and coordinate a simple plan: one or two Sirens make the lure (voice, distress call, or mimicry), the rest wait in the water to drag victims under, disable boats, and finish anyone who falls overboard. They don’t bargain, ransom, or trade; they kill quickly, then strip bodies and wrecks for tools. Shoals rank members by confirmed kills, not age, and they train juveniles by having them assist in drags before allowing a first kill. Standard rules are: leave no witnesses, move hunting grounds if patrols increase, destroy evidence (nets, ropes, anchors) after a hit, and relocate the shoal if a lure is identified. They keep territory clear of other predators and attack any trespassers, including other Siren packs, to protect their hunting routes.\nOther:\n\nAmphibious: You can breathe air and water.\nTidal Morph: While submerged, your legs become a tail (you cannot use normal land movement, but your swim speed is 50 ft). Out of water, your legs return (you cannot use swim speed unless submerged). Switching is instantaneous when entering/exiting water.\nSiren’s Call (1/Short Rest): As an Action, target one creature within 60 ft that can hear you. It must make a Wisdom Save (DC 15). On a failure, it is Charmed by you for 2 rounds and must use up to 10 ft of its movement on its next turn to move closer to you (this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks). The charm ends early if the target is damaged.\nUndertow Step: While in water, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action once per turn. Difficult terrain in water doesn’t slow your movement.\nDrying Need: If you go 24 hours without submerging in water for at least 10 minutes, you gain -1 to attack rolls and ability checks until you submerge; this penalty stacks by -1 each additional day (the lowest they can make your stats go is 4), and all penalties are removed after submerging for 10 minutes.\n\nPositive Affinities: Water, Utility, Creation\nNeutral Affinities: Air, Generic\nNegative Affinities: Fire, Earth, Physical\nBonuses: +8 CHA, +2 WIS, +1 DEX, −1 STR"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Slarik":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Slarik","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Monstrous Races/Slarik.md","title":"Slarik","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Slarik\nHeight: 3’0 - 4’5\nWeight: 50 - 100 lbs\nLifespan: 40 - 80 years\nSize: Small\nSpeed: 25 ft, 40 ft swimming\nLanguage: Common, Cheloni\nDescription: Slarik are amphibious, slick skinned folk built for currents and confined spaces. Scales lie in fine overlapping plates that shed sand and silt, colored deep ocean blues, mangrove greens, or bright silver along the cheeks and spine. Neck slits pulse gently when they breathe, and webbing spans fingers and toes for sudden bursts through water or springy, low impact leaps on land. Eyes are bulbous and glass dark or gilded, adapted to read movement in murk, and their heads cant and click in short bursts when they map a flooded room or reef tunnel. Their speech mixes bubbling consonants with croaks and rapid clicks; sung lines carry surprisingly far underwater. Gear is minimal and corrosion smart: lacquered cords, shell buckles, bone blades, and waxed slings, all tied to sit flat so nothing snags in kelp or wreck rigging.\nCulture: Slarik clans root themselves where water talks—reef shelves, mangrove webs, drowned stonework—raising woven nests and shell halls that flex with tide and storm. Lineage follows the mother, and elders called Spine Watchers hold memory through song cycles that bundle history, law, and navigation into melodies everyone can learn by stroke and breath. Community runs communal: catch is pooled, tools rotate, and roles shift with season and current. Outsiders read their humor as slippery because tests and pranks are part of trust building; a guest who laughs, adapts, and listens earns a guide faster than one who bargains. Pacts with sea spirits and sworn promises to guard spawning grounds are taken seriously, and pollution or net thievery is answered fast and in force. Children learn three arts early—song for memory, stillness for stalking, and surge for the strike—and most adults can fight as a pod, breaking lines with timed pushes and drag pulls that turn the water itself into a weapon.\nOther:\n\nAmphibious: You can breathe air and water.\nMurkwatch Vision: Underwater dim light imposes no penalties on your Spot checks, and you can see clearly through silt or algae up to 30 ft.\nCurrent Sense: You have advantage on Search checks made underwater.\nSeagrip: You have advantage on Climb checks on wet stone, ship timbers, or algae slick surfaces.\nToxin Hardy: You are immune to natural poisons and diseases.\nTidal Step: Shallow water, seaweed, and similar natural aquatic ground do not count as difficult terrain for you.\n\nPositive Affinities: Water, Utility, Creation\nNeutral Affinities: Generic, Craft\nNegative Affinities: Fire, Earth, Air\nBonuses: +3 DEX, +2 WIS, -2 CHA"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Stonekin":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Stonekin","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Monstrous Races/Stonekin.md","title":"Stonekin","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 5-12 ft\nWeight: 200-1100 lbs\nLifespan: 1000-2000 years\nSize: Large\nSpeed: 30 ft\nLanguage: Dwarvish, Common\nDescription: Stonekin are towering humanoids formed of living stone and crystal, bodies hewn by pressure and time rather than birth. Their frames are rough and angular, veined with mineral seams and faceted inclusions that catch the light as if a mountain were learning to move. Faces are blocky and masklike, eyes set as glowing gemstones, and voices rumble like shifting earth. No two Stonekin share the same geology, some glint with quartz or opal, others glow with dull magma red from deeper seams. Though heavy in appearance, their motion is deliberate and surprisingly fluid, each step placed with the certainty of bedrock.\nCulture: Stonekin define identity through endurance. Conflict is not hatred to them, it is proof of purpose, a way to feel the world press back. They wander for long spans between clashes, testing themselves against great beasts, relentless elements, or one another when consent and ground are agreed. Old fortresses and crystal halls exist in stories and ruins, but most Stonekin now keep to solitude, meeting by gesture and challenge rather than long speech. Promises are short and literal, debts are paid in labor or blows, and memory is measured in strata, events layered and compressed into lessons they trust more than songs.\nOther:\n\nLithic Resilience: You have resistance to slashing damage and piercing damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.\nStonebond Regeneration: While you are in contact with solid natural stone (not sand, wood, or metal) at the start of your turn, you regain 1d4 Vitality.\nDarkvision: You can see in darkness up to 60 ft.\n\nPositive Affinities: Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Physical, Creation\nNeutral Affinities: Generic\nNegative Affinities: Utility, Craft\nBonuses: +4 STR, +10 CON, -4 WIS, -5 INT, -5 CHA\nStonekin, Alternative Layered Model\nDescription: These Stonekin are composed of two functional strata, an Outer Layer and an Inner Core. The Outer Layer is the armored crust that meets the world; the Inner Core is the animating heart. Each stratum can be a different material, shaping defenses and traits. Eyes are gem bright, edges are jagged, and the whole form moves with slow certainty as mass and leverage shift inside the shell.\nBonuses: +2 STR, +4 CON, -4 WIS, -4 INT, -4 CHA\nOther: Darkvision 60 ft, advantage on CON saving throws\nNegatives: -10 Base Acc to all attack types, disadvantage on INT, WIS, and CHA checks and saving throws\nCore rules, Layered Composition:\n\nYou track three durability channels: Vitality (as normal for Eyum), plus Outer Layer HP and Inner Core HP.\nDamage application order after Vitality is broken through or bypassed: Outer Layer HP first, then Inner Core HP. If the Inner Core is reduced to 0, you die.\nHealing: Normal healing and magic restore Vitality only. They do not restore Outer Layer HP or Inner Core HP.\nLevel recovery: When you gain a level, fully restore both Layer totals to their current maximums, then add your class Hit Die roll (plus CON modifier if your class adds it) to both Outer Layer HP and Inner Core HP. There is no cap; these totals accumulate each level.\nSheet tracking: Record Inner Core HP in your HP field and Outer Layer HP as your Max HP value for ease of reference.\n\nRegeneration and repair:\n\nNatural regeneration does not restore either Layer.\nStonebond Regeneration (if used from the standard model) still restores only Vitality.\n\nDamage types and interactions:\n\nUnless a material below states otherwise, you take damage normally.\nAny effect that “ignores resistance” or “deals true damage” affects Layers normally.\nEffects that reference “healing” still do not restore Layer HP.\n\nMaterial selection:\nChoose one material for your Outer Layer and one for your Inner Core at character creation.

If both strata grant speed modifiers, apply both while both remain.\n“Reflect,” “explode,” or “retaliate” effects trigger only while the relevant stratum has HP remaining, and only as often as stated.\nIf a rule would render you immune to a damage type while a weakness would make you vulnerable to that same type, apply vulnerability first, then immunity if still applicable, per GM adjudication.\n\nThis alternative model is significantly more complex than the standard Stonekin. Use only with GM approval and ensure all Layer totals and material effects are recorded clearly on the character sheet."},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Thauryx":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Monstrous-Races/Thauryx","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Monstrous Races/Thauryx.md","title":"Thauryx","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: 6’0 - 7’5\nWeight: 220 - 360 lbs\nLifespan: 90 - 150 years\nSize: Medium\nSpeed: 30 ft\nLanguage: Draconic, Common\nDescription: Thauryx are draconic humanoids plated in overlapping scales the color of worked metal or firelit glass, bronze and gold through obsidian and deep crimson. Horn crests or spine ridges crown the brow, eyes shine like cut gems, and heat or static seems to thrum in the chest when they draw breath. Hands end in heavy talons and feet grip like a raptor’s, with a counterbalancing tail that steadies charges and pivots. Their voices carry a low, furnace rumble, and posture is naturally commanding, shoulders set square and chin lifted as if addressing a hall.\nCulture: Thauryx trace blood and honor to ancient wyrms and keep proud clan holds where oaths, rites of ancestry, and trials of mastery govern status. Deeds earn place, especially control over the “inner flame,” the disciplined channeling of elemental breath and temper. Words bind across generations; a broken oath stains the clan’s name until answered by service or sacrifice. Leadership is expected to be decisive and instructive, and rival clans often clash where purpose or pride collides. They respect power, purpose, and recorded history, and their lore keeps tally of line victories, breath disciplines, and mentors who taught restraint as well as wrath.\nOther:\n\nBreath Weapon: Once per short rest, exhale power as a 15 ft cone or a 30 ft line.

They shamble when calm, then lunge with horrifying speed the instant blood is in the air.\nCulture: Trolls don’t build; they claim. They haunt ruins, cave networks, and shadowed forests, bullying Tull and Grull into service. Leadership is whoever hit the hardest most recently.

While individually unimpressive, their strength lies in numbers, when gathered in swarms, Tull move with chaotic precision, overwhelming larger foes through sheer persistence.\nCulture: Tull have no formal civilization. They are scavengers and opportunists, living in small nests or following larger, stronger leaders, often other monstrous races who tolerate their presence in exchange for their nimble theft and surprising persistence. While they can be cunning, they are rarely cooperative unless compelled by fear or necessity. Most Tull spend their lives raiding farms, caravans, and settlements, stealing whatever they can carry before fleeing into the wilderness.

The face and overall frame remain humanoid, but distinct animal traits replace or overlay features such as ears, eyes, hands, legs, feet, or tail. These traits are not cosmetic, they carry usable physiology and instincts. A Therianthrope’s mannerisms often echo the source animal, quick glances and sudden stillness in cat lines, open alert posture and rapid tail signaling in dog lines, heavy-set power and deliberate motion in bear lines, twitchy head movements and light stride in bird lines, and so on. Clothing is adapted for tails, wings, or unusual gait, with reinforced seams and harness points for gear. Most individuals learn a “quiet stance” to keep their animal tells in check during negotiation or travel among strangers.\nCulture: Therianthropism is a recessive, heritable condition that can appear in most peoples. The animal lineage, once expressed, remains constant down that branch of the family. Two Therianthrope parents do not guarantee a Therianthrope child, but when a child is born affected, it matches the parent’s animal line unless a different recessive line expresses from the other side. Aurians cannot express Therianthropism, and Aurian blood suppresses expression for roughly four generations. Social response varies by region and people, some communities prize Therianthropes as scouts, couriers, or champions, others stigmatize them as unstable. Most Therianthropes learn to navigate both admiration and suspicion. Affinities are inherited from the original race first, then the animal line may add additional positives as noted below.\nSubtypes by animal line\nChoose one animal line when you create a Therianthrope.

In daylight they pass as their base race, though canines run a little long, eyes catch too much light, and a faint animal musk clings to their clothes. When the pulse quickens, anger, fear, or the call of the moon, the Hybrid emerges: fur along the forearms and spine, digitigrade legs, lengthened jaw with killing teeth, and hands that end in hooked claws capable of rending mail. Voices deepen to a lupine rasp; scents read like sentences: fear, iron, rain, lies. In full bestial focus, the world narrows to wind direction, heartbeat, footing, and the clean geometry of the chase.\nCulture: Most werewolves keep to moon-lodges, loose, secret networks that teach control, set hunting codes, and police their own. “No blood without a reason” is the first law; “no broken oath” is the last. Packs treat the curse as a demanding craft: diet, drills, breathwork, and ritual sparring under silvered brands. Some lodges serve as night-wardens for border towns, paid in meat and discretion. Others become road-wolves, selling nose and claw to caravans as pathfinders and ambush-breakers. Within the pack, status is earned by restraint more than rage. Lone werewolves (called strays) wander until a deed or debt binds them. Silver is taboo and kept for penance and trial by pain; those who abuse the curse are marked and hunted by their own.\nOther:\n\nShapeshift (Hybrid): As an Action, transform between Humanoid and Hybrid.

It can affect any living creature except those inherently immune to disease and undeath (such as Veythari, Relicwraiths, Smogborn, and Ferramites). The infection spreads through the magical corruption of blood and tissue rather than through natural pathogens.\nTransmission:\n\nAny living creature bitten by a Rotborn or Witherkin must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC in Statblock) or become infected. Each subsequent bite increases the DC by 2. \nIf the bite reduces the target to 0 HP, the saving throw is automatically failed.\nMagical healing applied before the end of the creature’s next turn removes the infection before it takes hold, but if you are not healed quickly enough you must use a spell such as Purge Corruption to remove the effect before it kills the creature. \n\nEffects on Different Targets:\n\nPlayer Characters/NPCs (Sentient Races): Once infected, the target’s health begins to fail rapidly. At the start of each long rest, the target must succeed on another Constitution saving throw (DC 12 + 1 for each day since infection). On a failure, they take 2d10 damage to health, if this kills them they rise as a Rotborn after 1d6 hours, at this point it is impossible to save them. If killed by any means while infected, they immediately rise as a Rotborn unless burned to ash.\nAnimals: Infected animals die and rise as bestial Rotborn versions of themselves after 1d4 hours, losing all special training and becoming aggressive to all living creatures.\nMonsters: Infected monsters become Rotborn variants of their species after 1d4 hours, retaining only physical abilities that do not require complex thought. \n\nBecoming a Witherkin Instead of a Rotborn\n\nWhen a creature dies while infected and would normally rise as a Rotborn, they may immediately attempt a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18). On a success, the creature rises as a Witherkin instead. For the next 7 days, at the start of each day, the creature must repeat the same saving throw (DC 18). Failing even one of these saving throws causes the creature to lose their sentience and revert permanently to a Rotborn. If all 7 saving throws are passed, the transformation is stabilized, and the creature remains a Witherkin permanently.\nDuring the same 7-day period, the creature must also attempt an Intelligence saving throw (DC 16) at the start of each day to retain fragments of their past life. If all Intelligence saving throws fail, the Witherkin loses all memory of their previous existence by the end of the week, their mind becoming a blank slate. If at least one Intelligence saving throw is successful, their memories are not entirely lost, while inaccessible at first, they can be recovered over time through reliving similar experiences or encountering familiar people and places, as determined by the GM.\n\nSpecial Notes:\n\nRotborn bites bypass all resistance to disease.\nWitherkin may choose whether their bite carries the infection, but once delivered it cannot be undone.\nFire damage to the corpse before reanimation prevents the transformation entirely.\nSimilarly, burning the wound sufficiently quickly will also stop the spread. \nCreatures turned into Rotborn retain the general size, body shape, and physical stats of their original form but suffer all Rotborn penalties and gain all of the rotborn abilities.\nIf a creature survives the infection through passing the Infected Saving Throw 7 times in a row, they are immune to Rot Infection for 30 days before they can be infected again.\n\nThis immunity does not apply to witherkin bites as they are far more potent.\n\n\n"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Undead-Races/Noskara":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Undead-Races/Noskara","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Undead Races/Noskara.md","title":"Noskara","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Noskara\nHeight: 5’0 - 6’5\nWeight: 110 - 200 lbs\nLifespan: 120 - 480 years\nSize: Medium\nSpeed: 30 ft\nLanguage: Common, Noskaran\nDescription: Noskara are pale, sharp featured humanoids with blood hued eyes and elongated fangs set in precise, predatory smiles. Their skin is cool to the touch, and a faint chill seems to follow them into quiet rooms and crowded halls alike. Nails grow as fine, hard claws, tailored more often than cut, and their movements are unhurried, deliberate, and exact. Many favor austere finery or ritual dress that frames the face and throat, a cultivated image of control that suits voices smooth as lacquer and layered with an unplaceable accent. Even at ease they read the room, selecting words like tools and silences like blades.\nCulture: Noskara gather in cloistered courts and secluded covens where etiquette rules with the weight of law. They treat the world as stage and board both, measuring people as pieces, patrons, or prey. Long lives and sharper memories bind them to oaths, invitations, and old pacts; propriety is compulsion as much as preference, and a broken word can stain a name for a century. Power is currency, but restraint is art, and the most dangerous among them learn to feed appearances as carefully as they feed on blood. Some rule from shadow as patrons, others stalk openly as predators; many try to live among mortals under rigid codes that keep hunger and ambition from burning away the mask.\nOther:\n\nDarkvision: You can see in darkness up to 120 ft.\nUndead: You are technically counted as undead\nNecrotic Resilience: You have resistance to Necrotic damage.\nRadiant Aversion: You have vulnerability to Radiant damage.\nBlood Siphon: Once per turn when you hit a living creature with blood using a melee weapon attack, you restore 1d4 Vitality.

In manifestation they appear as shimmering silhouettes of color and light, edges wavering like heat haze, with only the suggestion of eyes and a mouth. Their steps make no sound, they cast no shadow, and their forms can slip partly into nonmagical matter without fully passing through it. Each Relicwraith’s Anchor, a weapon, relic, or trinket, is etched with runes or patterns that mirror its will; breaking this Anchor ends the Relicwraith. They manipulate the world through steady telekinetic technique rather than touch, arranging tools and moving objects with patient precision.\nCulture: Most Relicwraiths arise where magic peaks, when ambient mana coheres around an object during moments of shock or sacrifice. They are solitary by nature and avoid exposing their Anchors, relying on careful planning, layered wards, and strategic retreat rather than brute force. Small convocations form in places of strong mana to share glyphs, histories, and techniques for channeling through distance. Etiquette is strict: never ask to see another’s Anchor, never touch an Anchor without consent, never reveal an Anchor’s resting place. They prize ingenuity, control, and craft, recording memory as glyphwork and embedding insight directly into the Anchor’s design.\nOther:\n\nAnchor Bound: You are tethered to your Anchor and cannot willingly move more than 50 ft from it. If you are forcibly teleported, your Anchor teleports with you. If your Anchor is ever more than 50 ft from you due to outside effects, you are pulled to its space and become dormant until the start of your next turn.\nTwo Pools, One Life: You track manifestation Vitality as normal, but your manifestation has no Health. If an effect would bypass Vitality and deal Health damage, it instead reduces your Vitality. If your Vitality reaches 0, you immediately retreat into your Anchor and become dormant; you remanifest only after completing a full long rest. Your Anchor has no Vitality, only Health; if it is reduced to 0 Health, the Anchor is destroyed and you die.\nTargeting the Anchor: While you are carrying or wearing your Anchor, attacks against it target your AC and saving throws. If the Anchor is unattended, it uses object AC and saving throw rules at the GM’s discretion. Area effects that include your space also include your Anchor.\nIncorporeal Mantle: In manifestation form you are immune to all nonmagical damage that does not directly target your Anchor. Magical sources, enchanted weapons, or effects that explicitly harm incorporeal or mana based creatures affect you normally.\nCondition Immunities: In manifestation you are immune to the following conditions, blinded, deafened, grappled, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned.\nPhase Edge: You may overlap nonmagical solid matter by up to 2 inches. This does not allow passage through a barrier and you must end movement in an open space.\nSpectral Hands: You have two permanent telekinetic hands. Each can manipulate objects within 30 ft and lift up to 10 lbs independently, or 20 lbs together. They cannot wield weapons or make attacks. Finer tasks, locks, and tools can be handled as if with normal hands.\nArcane Focus: You gain +2 to your spell save DC and advantage on all spell attack rolls.\nFragile Force: You have disadvantage on Strength based attack rolls. When a Strength based attack you make deals damage, reduce that attack’s damage by 2 before applying modifiers.\nManifold Reserves: You gain +2 Vitality each time you gain a character level.\nDormant Form: While dormant inside the Anchor, you are unconscious and unaware.

Flesh sloughs, joints creak, and insects nest where organs once worked. They neither breathe nor tire nor feel pain, and they pursue living prey until destroyed or diverted. Memory, personality, and judgment are gone; only hunger remains. A Rotborn’s bite carries Rot Infection, a taint that guarantees the victim will rise as Rotborn upon death unless powerful magic purges the blight beforehand.\nCulture: None. Rotborn drift, then swarm when prey is near. Without direction they wander; under Witherkin or necromancer control they’re driven like siege cattle toward chosen targets.

You cannot cast spells, speak languages, or make complex plans. Simple commands such as “follow,” “guard,” “attack that,” or “bring bodies” can be obeyed if issued by a Witherkin or necromancer you recognize as a controller.\nResurrection Roll: When reduced to 0 Health, roll 1d20.

Remove equipment as the GM deems the corpse lost or ruined.\nCuring the blight: Before the creature dies, powerful purgative magic can remove Rot Infection. Suitable effects are set by the GM; examples include high tier cleanse, remove blight, or comparable restorative rituals. Once dead, only effects capable of returning a creature to life while purging curses and diseases prevent reanimation.\nFire sanctification: If the corpse takes any Fire damage before the reanimation occurs, the reanimation is delayed until after the next long rest that passes without the body taking Fire damage again. If sufficient fire wholly destroys the corpse, no reanimation occurs.\n\nFor more information see 3.2.0 Rot Infection Rules"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Undead-Races/Veythari":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Undead-Races/Veythari","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Undead Races/Veythari.md","title":"Veythari","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Height: Matches original race\nWeight: Matches original race\nLifespan: Slowed aging, approximately 10× the original race\nSize: Matches original race\nSpeed: Base race speed +5 ft\nLanguage: Original race, Noskaran\nDescription: The Veythari are made, not born. A living mortal survives the bite of a Veythari, and crimson, mana laced vitae rewrites flesh and spirit. The transformed retain their original race’s features and cultural markers, but the eyes take a subtle crimson, gold, or violet sheen and the canines lengthen to predatory fangs. Movements become unnervingly silent and precise, voice cadence turns compelling, and pulse, breath, and temperature drift toward stillness. They remain alive, but the altered physiology demands blood; without regular feeding the body weakens, reflexes dull, and spellwork frays.\nCulture: There is no single Veythari nation. Most hide among their birth peoples or keep to nocturnal enclaves under elder guidance. Common instincts emerge across lines, an aversion to open sunlight, constant awareness of nearby heartbeats, and fierce protection of secrecy. Etiquette among their kind is simple and strict, never reveal another Veythari’s nature to outsiders, never turn a new Veythari without cause, settle disputes away from witnesses, and repay debts quickly. Some rule from behind masks as patrons and scholars; others treat the condition as a curse and feed only when need overwhelms restraint.

Flesh is cold, gray, and slowly decaying, often stitched, scarred, or braced to delay the inevitable. Pale necrotic light pools in the eyes and the voice carries a hollow rasp. Memory of the former life is gone, but reason, speech, and intent remain. Movements are deliberate and heavy, and the living sense a wrongness in their presence. They do not require ordinary food, yet must periodically consume raw flesh to maintain cohesion, a managed necessity rather than an uncontrollable compulsion.\nCulture: Witherkin are exceedingly rare and tend to live alone or in tight bands that sometimes command packs of mindless dead. Many sell endurance for coin as mercenaries, wardens, or assassins, leveraging resilience where fear would stop the living. Shunned by most societies, they keep to margins, hidden ossuaries, or forgotten tunnels. Some embrace rulership over lesser undead; others choose strict codes to hold darker urges in check and seek work that grants purpose beyond slaughter.

Skin is rough and grooved, knotted by age and season, veined with living sap that can glow faintly at dusk. Eyes shine like polished amber, and crowns of leaves, moss, or vine rise from the brow and shoulders, shifting with climate and soil. Each Ent carries a unique seasonal bloom, flowers, berries, fungi, or resinous sap that reflects the land that first woke them. Limbs are root sure and heavy, fingers long enough to hook into stone, and when an Ent stands still the forest tries to claim them, leaf litter gathering at their feet until they move again.\nCulture: Ents do not merely live in groves, they extend them. They awaken from old trees where spirit and place agree, and carry the long memory of that ground. The day to day is patient craft, pruning blight, guiding growth, and listening to birds, insects, and wind lines across the canopy. Speech is slow and careful; most disputes end with stillness and shared listening rather than force. Yet when a boundary is crossed, an Ent moves like weather, tearing roads, breaking engines, and turning intruders aside with method rather than fury. Wisdom is passed by scent, touch, and gesture more than words, and young are raised communally by those who can spare seasons to teach. Outsiders who earn trust find a protector who plans in years, not hours, and keeps promises as faithfully as roots keep soil.\nOther:\n\nBarkhide: While not wearing manufactured armor, your natural armor sets your AC to 14 + CON mod.

In their natural state they are pale, hairless humanoids with featureless visages and skin that moves like liquid under a thin film. Most never show this shape in public. From youth they learn to sculpt bone lines, skin tone, gait, and voice with uncanny smoothness, swapping bodies as easily as clothing. Even in perfect masks their eyes betray them to careful watchers, they never throw a true catchlight, reading matte or “wrong” under bright illumination. Their manner is poised and economical, and their transformations complete between one heartbeat and the next with no half formed seams.\nCulture: Mirr clans keep hidden enclaves where members exchange True Names and histories under strict oath. Outside those spaces they live as actors, mediators, spies, artisans, or drifters, studying habits, dialects, and wardrobes until they can pass where others would stumble. Identity is a tool in Mirr thought, not a truth, and that philosophy unsettles many peoples who tie honor to a single face. Inside a clan the baseline ethic is consent and disclosure—who you are here, who you are out there, and what is shared with whom—because masks without rules break trust. Their arts prize observation, memory, and clean exits; a well executed departure is considered a craft equal to a rousing speech.\nOther:\n\nAssume Shape: As an action, take the appearance of a Small or Medium humanoid you have observed for at least 1 minute. You may alter height by up to ±6 inches and weight by up to ±30 percent, keeping the same Size. The change is physical (not an illusion) but does not grant traits, stats, or abilities of the copied race or person. Gear does not transform. The form lasts until you change again, fall unconscious, or die.\nPrepared Faces: You can imprint up to three specific appearances you have fully studied. You may switch to an imprinted face as a bonus action. Replacing an imprint takes 10 minutes of focused study of the target and erases one stored face of your choice.\nCopy Voice: You can reproduce any voice and common sounds you have heard in the last 24 hours. You have advantage on checks to impersonate that speaker’s cadence and manner.\nLightless Eyes: In bright light, a creature that spends a round observing you may attempt a Spot check, DC 15, to notice your eyes’ unnatural lack of reflection. A creature that physically examines you for a round may attempt a Search check, DC 14, to detect minute transition seams.

Hair is replaced by caps, fronds, or tendrils that mark age and origin, from shelf fungi that stack along the scalp to delicate gills that ripple when they “speak.” Eyes are opalescent and pupiless, taking in light as a soft sheen rather than a point. In darkness they glow faintly, bioluminescent threads pulsing under the surface. When injured they do not bleed; a thick nutrient ooze seeps out and seals like sap. Their gait is deliberate and heavy, better for rooting than running, and when they stand still the ground seems to welcome them back.\nCulture: Mycelari organize in circles, clusters of kin linked by memory sharing and shallow root webs. Councils are held in stillness, hours of shared recall followed by a single sentence that carries the consensus of many minds. They guard memory over novelty, keeping catacombs, burial groves, and ruin gardens where loss is cataloged and tended. Songs are breathed as sporesongs, harmonics that carry images and emotions rather than words, teaching routes, seasons, and griefs all at once. Outsiders find them quiet but not cold; a Mycelari who shares a memory with you has offered something weightier than speech. Their courtesies are simple, step lightly, return what you take, and make a place for the dead to rest.\nOther:\n\nSporelink Telepathy: You cannot speak verbally. You communicate telepathically as images and emotions to any number of willing creatures within 60 ft that you can sense. Language is not required, but mindless creatures cannot receive your messages.\nBioluminescence: You emit dim light in a 5 ft radius. You can suppress or resume this light as a bonus action.\nPoison Immunity: You are immune to Poison damage and the Poisoned condition. You have advantage on saving throws against disease.\nSoil Sustenance: You do not require food or drink if you spend at least 2 hours rooted in soil or rich compost each day.\nHyphal Compression: You can squeeze through openings as narrow as 4 inches without squeezing penalties. You have advantage on checks and saving throws to escape grapples, bindings, or manacles.\nSpore Veil: Once per short rest, as an action release a 10 ft radius cloud centered on you that lasts until the start of your next turn. Creatures of your choice that begin their turn in the cloud must succeed on a CON save, DC 12 + Proficiency Bonus + CON mod, or take 1d4 poison damage and suffer −1 Base Acc until the end of their turn. The area is lightly obscured.\nRoot and Mend: If you remain motionless and in contact with soil for 1 minute, you restore 1d4 Vitality to yourself.

Their bodies are light, flexible, and scar-free no matter how rough the work. In private, a Skinwalker’s flesh moves like warm wax, letting them re-form bone lines, hair, and skin tone in seconds. Clothing doesn’t change with them, so veterans favor layered, strap-fast gear that can pass for many cuts and cultures. The best way to describe a Skinwalker would be; Uncanny Valley. \nCulture: Most Skinwalkers scatter into other peoples’ cities, hiding in plain sight. Family units are small and mobile; safety comes from staying unremarkable, learning faces, and vanishing when attention rises. Their oral teaching is blunt: look, learn, replace. They keep caches of generic clothing, forged seals, and “safe-names” to rotate identities. Trust is earned by actions, not stories, anyone can wear a story. A few bands sell infiltration and witness-protection services; others run cons, heists, or counter-espionage for pay. \nOther:\n\nBorrowed Mask (Shapeshift): As a bonus action, assume the appearance of a Small or Medium humanoid you have observed for at least 1 minute. You can alter height by ±6 inches and weight by ±30%. The form is physical (not an illusion) but doesn’t change your stats. Your gear doesn’t transform. The change lasts until you shift again or are unconscious.\nCopy Voice: You can reproduce any voice and common sounds you’ve heard in the last 24 hours. You have triple advantage on checks to impersonate that speaker.\nSurface Checks: A creature that physically examines you for a round can attempt Investigation (DC 18) to detect seams in the disguise (DC 14 if you’ve taken damage since your last turn). Creatures which are familiar with whom you are impersonating have advantage on this check. \nMutable Physiology: Resistance to Poison damage and advantage on saving throws against disease.\nTell-Tale Glint: Mirrors, scrying pools, and similar reflections show a faint blue glow in your eyes.\n\nPositive Affinities: Utility, Generic\nNeutral Affinities: Air, Water, Earth\nNegative Affinities: Physical, Craft, Creation, Fire\nBonuses: +2 DEX, +4 CHA, +1 INT, -1 STR"},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Unique-Races/Wicklin":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.2-Races/Races/Unique-Races/Wicklin","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.2 Races/Races/Unique Races/Wicklin.md","title":"Wicklin","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Wicklin\nHeight: 3’5 - 4’5\nWeight: 30 - 80 lbs\nLifespan: 10 - 40 years\nSize: Small\nSpeed: 30 ft\nLanguage: Common\nDescription: Wicklin are living constructs made of wood, cloth, porcelain, or metal, animated by lost rites or errant sparks of magic. Button eyes, stitched smiles, joint seams, and tidy knots make many resemble toys or decorative dolls; others are cracked, patched, or plated with visible repairs. They neither breathe nor bleed, and their movements are precise but uncanny, like puppets whose strings are pulled from within. Some are lacquered and pristine; others wear scuffs and mends as a history of owners, places, and escapes. Though small and light, there is a stubborn will in the way a Wicklin squares its head and straightens a fraying seam.\nCulture: Most Wicklin awaken where they were left—attics, trunks, galleries, workshops—then slip into the world to find purpose. Without ancestry, they make families from the willing: other castoffs, caravan folk, stage troupes, and traveling circuses. Settlements, when they exist, are hidden and odd—a lantern lit railcar, a grove hung with wind chimes, a cellar stitched into rooms by colored thread. Names are sacred gifts, stories are kept like stitches, and mending is a rite. Their courtesies are simple: fix what you break, carry what you can, and remember who patched you last.\nOther:\n\nConstruct Nature: You do not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. You are immune to Poison damage, the Poisoned condition, disease, and drowning or suffocation. You can still take a full rest to recover abilities.\nMind Padding: You have resistance to Psychic damage. You are immune to magical sleep.\nMend and Stitch: During a short rest, if you have simple materials (thread, wire, glue, or rivets), you can restore 1d6 + your Proficiency Bonus Vitality to yourself.

Drawback, when you take bludgeoning damage from a critical hit, take +2 additional damage.\nMetal, Riveted Plates: Your natural armor sets your AC to 13 + DEX mod while not wearing manufactured armor.

While your core class defines your primary role (such as Cleric, Fighter, or Sorcerer), your subclass determines a more specific theme, philosophy, or combat style. Subclasses provide unique abilities and bonuses that expand your playstyle, allowing for greater customization and flavor.\nEach class has access to multiple subclass options, usually chosen at level 1. Some classes (such as Fighter or Rogue) may offer additional subclass features as you progress.\nExample:\nA Cleric might choose the Gravetender subclass to focus on necromancy and resurrection, or the Firelight subclass to emphasize healing and fire magic.\nSubclasses typically grant new abilities at specific level thresholds, usually at levels 1, 5, and 10. These features can be spells, passive traits, active powers, or transformations depending on the subclass.\nSubclass Feature Scaling\nSubclass abilities do not automatically increase in power as your character levels up. Unlike base class features or spells, subclass powers are flat in power unless specifically stated.\nIf a subclass feature doesn’t say it scales with level, then it does not.\nThis means:\n\nDamage numbers, duration, effect size, and uses per day all remain the same across levels, unless explicitly written otherwise.\nIf a subclass ability says “once per long rest” or “summons 2 minions,” that number does not change unless a feat, class ability, or GM ruling allows it.\n\nSubclass features are designed to remain useful and balanced without becoming dominant at higher levels. \nReminder: Only one subclass may be chosen per class unless a feature or feat allows otherwise."},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.3-Classes/3.3.2-Multiclassing":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.3-Classes/3.3.2-Multiclassing","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.3 Classes/3.3.2 Multiclassing.md","title":"3.3.2 Multiclassing","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Characters can take levels in multiple classes, gaining abilities from both.

If Vitalic is known, you may convert TP into +1 Vitality, +1 Health, or +1 Mana per TP (never over maximums). You may also designate your own current Mana as a Source for any Energymancy transfer; each TP spent this way reduces your current Mana by 1.\n\nSubclasses (choose 1 at level 1; +1 SL each Energyweaver level, max SL 5 per subclass)\nEnergymancy uses only the relevant Subclass Affinity (equal to SL).

They wield powerful abilities granted by their dedication to their chosen path.\n\nWeapons: Swords, Daggers, Axes, Hammers, Spears, Wands, Staffs\nSaving Throws: Strength, Charisma\nSpellcasting Modifier: Charisma\nProficiency Bonus: Starts at +2, increases every 3 levels\nProficiency with Light-Heavy Armor\n\nAs a paladin you may use your Charisma modifier for weapon attacks (melee or ranged). \nHit Dice: 1d8\nVitality Dice: 1d12\nMana Dice: 1d10\nMagical Gain - Oathbound Magic\nPaladins gain their magical abilities through Oaths that define their purpose. If a Paladin fails to uphold their oath, they lose their magic permanently and become an Oathbreaker. Oathbreakers must fulfill their oath through mortal means before regaining their powers.\nHow to choose an oath?\nWhen you become a Paladin, you must take an Oath, a personal vow that defines your character’s guiding moral principle or code of action. Unlike your subclass, which determines your mechanical features, your Oath is a narrative choice made between you and the GM. It is a statement of conviction that influences how your Paladin behaves, makes decisions, and earns divine favor.An Oath should be:\n\nSpecific enough to create consequences for keeping or breaking it.\nFlexible enough that it remains achievable across varied campaigns.\nRooted in conviction, not a casual preference.\nMade during character creation, in collaboration with the GM.\n\nYour Oath is not a mechanical restriction, but the GM may grant you advantage, bonuses, or narrative miracles when your actions clearly fulfill your Oath in a meaningful way. Likewise, repeated, willful violation of your Oath may lead to becoming an oathbreaker. \nExample Oaths\nOath of Vengeance\n“I swear to punish those who wrong the innocent, no matter the cost.”\n\nBroadly justifies aggressive justice.\nSupports lone-wolf or hunter playstyles.\n\nOath of Protection\n“I vow to shield the weak, even if it means my death.”\n\nEncourages tanking and sacrifice.\nRewards prioritizing others’ safety over your own.\n\nOath of Judgment\n“All who carry corruption must be purged from this world.”\n\nCreates tension when ‘gray areas’ arise.\nEncourages bold and direct actions.\n\nOath of Peace\n“Violence is the last resort; I will exhaust every peaceful path first.”\n\nGreat for diplomatic play or redemption arcs.\nStill allows combat, but only as a final answer.\n\nOath of Loyalty\n“My companions are my cause. I stand with them no matter what.”\n\nTies your Paladin to the party’s survival and goals.\nExcellent for morally gray teams needing a stable core.\n\nPaladin Subclasses (Choose 1 at level 3)\nEach oath grants different abilities based on a Paladin’s philosophy and dedication.\nHoly Warrior\nA Holy Warrior is devoted to divine service, fulfilling a religious duty or proving their worth to their deity.\n\nDivine Wrath: Add +1d8 radiant damage to melee attacks against fiends and undead.\nBlessed Shield: Gain +2 AC when using a shield.\nSacred Smite (1/Short Rest): Infuse your weapon with holy power, dealing an extra 2d10 radiant damage.\n\nOracle Seeker\nOracle Seekers dedicate themselves to ensuring prophecies come true, believing destiny must be fulfilled at all costs.\n\nForesight’s Blessing: Gain advantage on Situational Insight, Search, Spot, and Investigation checks.\nDestined Strike: Once per round, reroll an attack roll if it misses.\nBlind Believer: Gain disadvantage on Social Insight Checks and checks against Deception.\n\nSelfish Fighter\nThese Paladins took their oaths not out of devotion or duty, but for their own personal gain, be it power, fame, or revenge.\n\nDark Resilience: When below 50% Vitality, gain +1d4 damage on all attacks.\nUnyielding Ambition: You may reroll a failed saving throw once per combat.\nVengeful Strike: If an enemy has damaged you within the last round, your next attack deals double damage. You may use this up to Paladin Level + 3 times per long rest.\n\nWorld Healer\nWorld Healers are entirely selfless, taking their oaths not for gods or prophecy, but simply to help others.\n\nHealing Hands: Heal one creature (range touch) for 2 x PaladinLevel health points.\nGuardian’s Grace: When you heal an ally, you also heal for half of the amount healed.\nDivine Salvation (1/Long Rest): Instantly restore 10d8 HP to one creature (60 ft range).\n\nOathbreaker (Penalty State)\nIf a Paladin breaks their oath, they immediately suffer the following penalties:\n\nMagic Sealed: Cannot use paladin spells or divine abilities.\nWeakened Soul: -2 to all saving throws.\nFallen Aura: All allies within 10 ft suffer -1 to attack rolls while you remain Oathbroken.\nTo restore their Paladin status, they must fulfill their original oath through mundane means, proving their devotion through actions rather than magic, This is done at the GM’s discretion.\n\nLeveling Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevelDicePointsStats (Choose one for melee/ranged/magical each level)Special1+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+1 Skill Point+1d6 Base Damage (melee/ranged/magical); +1 Base Acc (melee/ranged/magical).2+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+3 Skill Point; +1 Proficiency Upgrade (or +1 Skill Point); +1 Affinity Point, +2 Stat Points, +1 Ap+1 Base AccLearn a Paladin spell.3+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+1 Skill Point; +1 BAp; +2 Stat Points+1d6 Base Damage; +1 Base Acc+2 AC.4+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+3 Skill Point; +1 Proficiency Upgrade (or +1 Skill Point); +1 Affinity Point, +2 Stat Points, +1 Ap+1 Base Acc+1 Feat; Learn a Paladin spell.5+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+1 Skill Point+1d6 Base Damage; +1 Base Acc6+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+3 Skill Point; +1 Proficiency Upgrade (or +1 Skill Point); +1 Affinity Point; +1 BAp; +2 Stat Points, +1 Ap+1 Base AccLearn a Paladin spell.7+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+1 Skill Point+1d6 Base Damage; +1 Base Acc8+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+3 Skill Point; +1 Proficiency Upgrade (or +1 Skill Point); +1 Affinity Point, +2 Stat Points, +1 Ap+1 Base Acc+1 Feat; Learn a Paladin spell.9+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+1 Skill Point; +1 BAp; +2 Stat Points+1d6 Base Damage; +1 Base Acc+2 AC.10+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+3 Skill Point; +1 Proficiency Upgrade (or +1 Skill Point); +1 Affinity Point, +2 Stat Points, +1 Ap+5 Base Acc; +5 Base Damage+1 Feat; Learn a Paladin spell.11+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+1 Skill Point+1d6 Base Damage; +1 Base Acc12+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+3 Skill Point; +1 Proficiency Upgrade (or +1 Skill Point); +1 Affinity Point; +1 BAp; +2 Stat Points, +1 Ap+1 Base Acc+1 Feat; +2 AC; Learn a Paladin spell.13+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+1 Skill Point+1d6 Base Damage; +1 Base Acc14+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+3 Skill Point; +1 Proficiency Upgrade (or +1 Skill Point); +1 Affinity Point, +2 Stat Points, +1 Ap+1 Base AccLearn a Paladin spell.15+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+1 Skill Point; +1 BAp; +2 Stat Points+1d6 Base Damage; +1 Base Acc+2 AC.16+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+3 Skill Point; +1 Proficiency Upgrade (or +1 Skill Point); +1 Affinity Point, +2 Stat Points, +1 Ap+1 Base Acc+1 Feat; Learn a Paladin spell.17+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+1 Skill Point+1d6 Base Damage; +1 Base Acc18+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+3 Skill Point; +1 Proficiency Upgrade (or +1 Skill Point); +1 Affinity Point; +1 BAp; +2 Stat Points, +1 Ap+1 Base Acc+2 AC; Learn a Paladin spell.19+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+1 Skill Point+1d6 Base Damage; +1 Base Acc20+1 VitDice, +1 HitDice, +1 ManaDice+3 Skill Point; +1 Proficiency Upgrade (or +1 Skill Point); +1 Affinity Point, +2 Stat Points, +1 Ap+5 Base Acc; +5 Base Damage+1 Feat; Learn a Paladin spell."},"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.3-Classes/Classes/Mixed-Classes/Runemaster":{"slug":"Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.3-Classes/Classes/Mixed-Classes/Runemaster","filePath":"Chapter 3 - Character Creation/3.3 Classes/Classes/Mixed Classes/Runemaster.md","title":"Runemaster","links":["Chapter-6---Magic-and-Abilities/6.4-Runes/6.4.1-Runes","Chapter-6---Magic-and-Abilities/6.4-Runes/6.4.2-Xeran-Runes","Chapter-6---Magic-and-Abilities/6.4-Runes/6.4.3-Serenite-Runes","Chapter-6---Magic-and-Abilities/6.4-Runes/6.4.4-Vindroth-Runes"],"tags":[],"content":"The Runemaster is a specialized spellcaster who uses runes rather than traditional spellcasting.

These beings grant power to their followers in exchange for devotion, service, or sacrifice.\nIf you don’t find a deity or patron that fits your character concept, you are encouraged to work with the Game Master to homebrew a new one.\nDivine Gifts &amp; Pact Benefits\n\nThe bonuses granted by a deity or patron are determined by the Game Master.\nIn most cases, these benefits scale as you level up, reflecting your deepening bond with your chosen god or patron.\n\nBreaking an Oath or Pact\nClerics and Warlocks draw their power from an external being, a god or patron. If you act in a way that clearly goes against the beliefs or expectations of that being, you may lose your powers.\nThis is always up to the Game Master (GM), but the punishment should fit the severity of the betrayal.\nHow It Works\n\nClerics serve gods, who tend to be more flexible but also more judgmental. They care about long-term devotion and alignment with their values.\nWarlocks serve patrons, who tend to be more transactional. If you break your deal, you lose your powers, simple as that.\n\nFor example, if your Warlock pact says you must kill one person per year and you fail to do so, your powers are revoked until you fulfill your end of the deal or renegotiate.\nGods are more nuanced. The GM will interpret how your god would react based on:\n\nThe god’s alignment and domain\nTheir described behavior\nHow often and how severely you’ve acted against their will\n\nIf you worship Erebos (god of death and undeath) and spend all your time healing people and preserving life, he’s going to be unhappy. He might tolerate it if you have a justification (like healing so you can kill more later), but if your actions directly oppose his ideals, you’ll lose access to your divine magic.\nYou Will Always Be Warned First\nDeities and patrons will not cut you off without warning. You will typically receive one or more warnings while communing with them, visions, omens, dreams, or direct messages. If you ignore these warnings, you’ll lose access to your powers until you:\n\nComplete a quest to redeem yourself,\nMake an offering or sacrifice, or\nFind a new patron or god who aligns better with your goals.\n\nBreaking a pact or oath should always be a story moment, not just a mechanical punishment.\nCommunicating with Your Patron\n\nClerics and Warlocks may attempt to contact their patron at any time.\nThe response (if any) is up to the GM, and may depend on the character’s devotion or the deity’s whims.\n\nAscending to Godhood\n\nOnce a player ascends to deity status, their Cleric and Warlock levels become permanent and no longer rely on their former patron.\nThey are now a fully independent divine entity, free to grant power to others, should they wish.\n\nDeity Specific Spells\nEach Deity grants three powerful spells, unlocked at levels 5, 10, and 20 of either the Cleric or Warlock class. These spells are unique to the deity and reflect their domain and will.\nTo cast one of these deity-specific spells, you must commune with the deity and receive explicit permission, every single time you use the spell. A deity will only grant permission if your intended use directly aligns with their goals, values, or desires.\nIf the deity disapproves (GM’s discretion), the spell fails completely, regardless of cost or preparation.\nTypes of Deities\nCelestials \n(Gods of Faith and Power) - For Clerics\nCelestials were once mortals who ascended to divinity. Their strength is directly tied to the number and devotion of their followers. They grant divine magic and blessings to those who uphold their tenets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeityAlignmentDescriptionWhat is required of youDagganLawful NeutralGod of War, Strength, Earth; follower locales: Crystal Veil and across Eyum; symbol: a hammer cracked in half.ErebosChaotic EvilGod of Death, Darkness, Undead; follower locales: Iron Spire, Phantomwood, global cults; symbol: skeletal hand from a black sun.PrimordiaNeutral GoodGoddess of Life, Light, Healing; locales: Lunar Plains, Saharath; symbol: golden tree in sunlight.PyraxisChaotic NeutralGod of Fire, Destruction, Rebirth; locales: Ember Wastes, Saharath; symbol: burning sword crossed with an arrow.ThalassosLawful NeutralGod of Water, Cold, Oceans; locales: coastal regions, deep seas; symbol: cresting wave with trident.GalaadLawful GoodGod of Stone, Earth, Endurance; locales: mountains, underground civilizations; symbol: mountain with rising sun.ZephyrusChaotic GoodGod of Air, Storms, Weather; symbol: a gust of wind forming an eagle; master of winds and tempests.GeableLawful GoodGod of Heroism, Glory, Courage; followers “everywhere heroes rise”; symbol: golden shield.WillowNeutral EvilGoddess of Shadows, Secrets, Illusions; locales: Shadow Realm, hidden enclaves; symbol: violet eyes in darkness.BellatrixChaotic NeutralGoddess of Beauty, Fashion, Vanity; locales: courts of nobility, cities; symbol: silver mirror.OthmarChaotic NeutralGod of Knowledge, Secrets, Prophecy; locales: libraries, seer-circles; symbol: an open eye over a scroll.KoraNeutral GoodGoddess of Fertility, Home, Hearth; locales: villages, farmlands; symbol: woven wheat and flame.RamesesLawful NeutralGod of the Sun, Sky, Judgment; locales: sun temples; symbol: radiant sun over scales.SaramamaGoodGoddess of Animal, Instinct, Wild; locales: tribal/nomadic; symbol: hunter’s totem, animal prints.AnaniNeutralGoddess of Moon, Night, Dreams; locales: scholars, poets; symbol: crescent moon with stars.QinglongLawful GoodGod of the East, Discipline, Oath; symbol: Eastern dragon coiled around a spear.XenoLawful NeutralGod of Runes, Order, Time; symbol: intricate rune circle.RamaChaotic GoodGod of Wisdom, Humility, Patience; symbol: folded hands before a lotus.AsklepiadesLawful GoodGod of Medicine, Healing, Purity; symbol: silver serpent around a staff.PolyhymniaLawful NeutralGoddess of Strategy, War Tactics, Wisdom; symbol: quill, shield, laurel.KhufuNeutralGod of Commerce, Wealth, Bargains; symbol (merchant’s coin &amp; open palm appears in table).AdiraLawful EvilGoddess of Control, Law, Authority; symbol: a gavel with broken chains.CaesarChaotic NeutralGod of Feasting, Excess, Indulgence; symbol: golden goblet overflowing.GodLawful NeutralDeity of Law, Balance, Judgment; symbol: perfectly balanced scale.\nFiends \n(Gods of Destruction &amp; Chaos) - For Warlocks\nFiends crave destruction and corruption.

Titles are earned through significant achievements or actions that impact a large group of people. They are a mark of honor (or infamy) and can shape how others perceive and interact with your character.\nWhy Have a Title?\nTitles serve two main purposes:\n\nConvey Authority: Titles like “Lord of Genflen” or “High Priest of Eldath” signify leadership or status.\nConvey Feats: Titles like “Dragonslayer” or “Hero of Eyum” highlight extraordinary accomplishments.\n\nTitles are given, not chosen, and are often bestowed by deities, rulers, or communities. For example:\n\nBecoming the ruler of a city might grant you the title “Lord of Genflen.”\nLeading a massacre might earn you the title “Deathbringer.”\n\nTitles can become so well-known that people recognize you more by your title than your name. However, not all titles are positive, infamous titles like “Warlord” or “Betrayer” can lead to fear or hostility.\nTitle Bonuses\nTitles often come with small bonuses tied to their nature. These bonuses are determined by the GM and reflect the title’s significance. For example:\n\nLord of Genflen: +2 Charisma or advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with subjects of that land.\nDeathbringer: -2 Charisma and advantage on attacks against innocent people.\n\nBonuses are entirely at the GM’s discretion and should align with the title’s meaning and how it was earned.\nSelf-Assigned Titles\nWhile titles are typically earned, characters can assign themselves titles. However, self-assigned titles only provide bonuses if the character lives up to the title’s expectations. For example:\n\nA character calling themselves “Hero of Eyum” won’t gain any bonuses until they perform heroic deeds worthy of the title.\n\nSelf-assigned titles are more about role-playing and establishing a reputation than providing mechanical benefits.\nGods and Titles\nDeities often grant titles to mortals as a sign of recognition. These titles are usually bestowed upon clerics, paladins, or other devout followers. Examples include:\n\nChampion of (God’s Name)\nHarbinger of (God’s Domain)\n\nThe bonuses granted by divine titles are limited by the deity’s power. For example, a minor deity might grant a small bonus, while a major deity could provide significant benefits.\nMultiple Titles\nAs your character progresses, they may earn multiple titles. You can choose to introduce yourself with any or all of your titles, and you gain the bonuses from all titles. For example:\n\nA character might be both “Lord of Genflen” and “Dragonslayer,” gaining bonuses from both titles.\n\nLosing a Title\nTitles can be revoked or replaced if a character fails to live up to them.

XP costs start modest and rise steadily but not too quickly.\n\n\nLevel 1 is free (you start at 0 XP).\n\n\nLevel 2 requires 1,000 XP.\n\n\nFrom there, each level costs more than the last, with the increase growing slightly at each step.\n\n\nFormula (for levels 2 to 20):\nXP required to level up = 1000 + 100 × (L − 2) + 100 × (L − 2)(L − 1)/2\nThis equation has three parts:\n\n\n1000: the base cost to reach level 2.\n\n\n100 × (L − 2): adds 100 XP per level after level 2.\n\n\n100 × (L − 2)(L − 1)/2: increases the amount gained per level at a mild accelerating rate.\n\n\nThis is effectively a quadratic curve that grows steadily but remains manageable for normal campaigns.\nPhase 2: Levels 21 to 30 - Major Power Spike\nLevel 20 represents the end of normal mortal progression. Beyond this point, characters are entering high-powered, epic-tier gameplay.\n\n\nThe XP required to level up jumps dramatically.\n\n\nThis spike separates regular progression from post-legendary scaling.\n\n\nFormula (for levels 21 to 30):\nXP required to level up = 10,000 × (L − 20)\nSo:\n\n\nLevel 21 costs 10,000 XP.\n\n\nLevel 22 costs 20,000 XP.\n\n\nLevel 30 costs 100,000 XP to reach.\n\n\nThis linear formula increases XP by a flat 10,000 per level, starting at Level 21.\nPhase 3: Levels 31 to 300 - High-Level Linear Scaling\nAfter Level 30, the XP cost stabilizes into a more sustainable high-level progression.\n\n\nXP required per level still increases, but at a slower and consistent rate.\n\n\nThis phase supports long-term, high-level campaigns (divine, cosmic, or planar in scale).\n\n\nFormula (for levels 31 to 300):\nXP required to level up = 130,000 + 15,000 × (L − 30)\n\n\nLevel 31 costs 145,000 XP.\n\n\nLevel 32 costs 160,000 XP.\n\n\nEach new level adds 15,000 more XP to the requirement.\n\n\nThe number 130,000 ensures continuity from the earlier spike, keeping the curve smooth across transitions.\nTotal XP to Reach a Given Level\nIf you want to calculate the total XP needed to reach any level (not just the XP between two levels), you add together all the individual XP requirements for each level up to that point.\nIn math terms:\nTotal XP to reach level L = sum of XP_to_Level(k) from k = 2 to L\nSo for example:\n\n\nTo reach level 5, you add the XP required for levels 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n\nTo reach level 21, you sum the XP required from level 2 through 21.\n\n\nThis gives you the total accumulated XP a character must earn across their whole career.\nEarning XP from Combat\nWhen characters defeat monsters, they gain XP based on the monster’s Challenge Rating (CR).\nXP = CR × 100\nThis is the base XP per monster, before adjusting for party size or challenge modifiers. The GM may award bonus XP for difficult fights, clever tactics, or defeating enemies far above your level.\nXP Split Between Party Members\nIf multiple characters participate, divide the monster’s XP evenly among them unless one player clearly did all the work.\nEarning XP from Tasks and Quests\nYou can also gain XP from:\n\n\nCompleting major quests: 100-1,000 XP\n\n\nSolving puzzles or riddles: 50-250 XP\n\n\nRoleplay, diplomacy, or narrative success: 50-300 XP\n\n\nSurviving dangerous travel: 25-100 XP\n\n\nDiscovering powerful lore or secrets: variable\n\n\nThese are guidelines, not fixed numbers.

As a Game Master, it can be difficult to keep track of all the places players have visited. To maintain consistency and help players navigate, it’s a good idea to create a map and track their movements. This ensures that locations remain coherent and memorable throughout the game.\n5.1.2 Factions and Organizations\nRecurring factions and organizations can add depth to your world and make encounters more meaningful. For example, a mysterious cult that players encounter early on might later reveal itself to be a major force, creating a full-circle moment in the story. Having established factions gives players a sense of continuity and allows for more dynamic storytelling.\n5.1.3 History and Lore\nYou don’t need an extensive history or deep lore to create a compelling story. While well-developed lore can enhance immersion, you can also let players fill in the blanks with their imagination. Sprinkle hints and vague details throughout the game and allow them to speculate, sometimes, their ideas can be more interesting than what you originally planned. If something resonates with them, you can develop it further over time without needing to build an entire world in advance.\n5.1.4 Reputation and Factions\nReputation is a measure of how well-known and well-regarded a character is by specific groups, factions, or regions. Factions are organized groups, governments, guilds, religions, or cultures with goals and influence across the world of Eyum.\nTracking Reputation\nEvery character begins with 0 reputation with all factions unless the GM specifies otherwise.

Motivations vary, some players seek wealth, others power, and some just want to explore. While “save the world” stories are classic, they aren’t always necessary. You can have overarching events unfold in the background, letting players decide whether they want to get involved. If they ignore the growing threat and the world ends, that’s on them.\n5.2.2 NPCs and Villains\nNPCs and villains should be memorable and, if possible, recurring. It’s no fun to introduce an interesting character only for the players to kill them off or leave without any further interaction. Pay attention to how your players respond to certain NPCs, if they take an interest in someone, consider bringing that character back later. A recurring villain or rival can make for a compelling ongoing conflict, adding stakes to the story.\n5.2.3 Rewards and Treasures\nRewards should reflect the players’ achievements. If they put significant effort into something, they should be compensated, whether with a powerful artifact, gold, or even a level-up. While XP systems provide structure, the most important thing is that players have fun.

That said, a contrast between a serious world and comedic characters can be interesting if executed well.\n5.3.4 Homebrew Rules and Content\nYou are free to homebrew any rules or content in The World of Eyum as long as the players are aware of and agree to the changes. Homebrewed spells, monsters, and races can spice up both roleplaying and combat, allowing for a more personalized and unique experience."},"Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/5.4-Planes-of-Existence":{"slug":"Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/5.4-Planes-of-Existence","filePath":"Chapter 5 - Worldbuilding (WIP)/5.4 Planes of Existence.md","title":"5.4 Planes of Existence","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The World of Eyum does not exist in isolation. It is part of a vast, layered cosmology made up of interconnected dimensions known as planes of existence. These planes overlap, conflict, and bleed into each other, sometimes subtly, sometimes catastrophically. Understanding these realms is essential for worldbuilding, magic lore, and the nature of gods, demons, and the soul.\nPlanes are not necessarily physical locations; they are states of reality with their own laws, inhabitants, and magical traits.\nThe Material Plane (Eyum)\nThe Material Plane, also called the World of Eyum, is the foundational layer of existence where matter and magic coexist in balanced tension. It is the realm of mortal life, linear time, and physical laws, where stone falls, fire burns, and the arcane obeys learned structure. Every civilization, creature, and story begins here, and the majority of adventures take place within its boundaries. It is neither the highest nor lowest of the planes, but it acts as the anchor to which all others are bound. Magic functions predictably here, shaped by ritual, emotion, and effort. Creatures that inhabit the Material Plane include mortals, natural beasts, most monsters, and artificially created constructs. The gods, though born or ascended from higher realms, often focus their influence here through dreams, omens, or empowered servants. Souls originate in the Material Plane and may reincarnate, pass into judgment, or be lost to other planes depending on their death and spiritual alignment. While it appears stable, the veil between this plane and others is thin in certain regions, ancient ruins, wild magic zones, or sites of immense tragedy may act as natural rifts or echo chambers, allowing bleed-throughs from deeper realms. In such places, light may flicker without cause, memories may linger unnaturally, or weather may reflect unseen forces. Though the Material Plane feels grounded and physical, it is constantly shaped by the whispers of the unseen cosmos pressing in from beyond.\nThe Nyxrealm (Shadow Plane)\nThe Nyxrealm is a layered, distorted echo of the Material Plane, a half-formed shadow world built from memory, sorrow, and forgotten truths. It mirrors the real world imperfectly: structures exist where buildings once stood, forests flicker where dreams of trees remain, and cities manifest as hollow shells of long-lost moments. Everything here is dim, colorless, and weighed down by silence. Time flows strangely, perception warps under emotional stress, and light struggles to persist. The Nyxrealm is not inherently evil, but it is deeply unnatural, shaped by what is absent more than what is present. It is inhabited by strange entities born from emotion and memory, Nyctaris, whispershades, lost souls, and predators that feed not on flesh but on attention, identity, or unresolved grief. Travelers here may find themselves pursued by fragments of their own past, or forced to relive memories made manifest in haunting, distorted form. Entry into the Nyxrealm is possible through certain rituals, artifacts, or locations where grief, neglect, or longing have left deep psychic scars. Some dreamwalkers and cursed beings can slip between it and the waking world, though often at great cost. Visibility is low, color is absent, and sound carries farther than it should. Magic tied to illusion, mind, and necrosis grows stronger here, while divine light and healing may falter. While most visit only by accident or misfortune, a few powerful beings build strongholds within the Nyxrealm, protected by layers of unreality and illusion. To linger too long here is to risk becoming part of it, a hollow imprint, remembered only by shadow.\nThe Aether (Celestial Plane)\nThe Aether is the sacred realm of the gods, a sealed and untouchable plane where only divine beings may reside. It is a place of flawless harmony and eternal brilliance, utterly separate from the mortal experience. Unlike other planes, the Aether is not accessible through magic, ritual, or death; no spell opens its gates, and no soul ascends here unless already divine. It is beyond comprehension, immune to corruption, and closed to all lesser beings. The Aether is not shaped by terrain or time, but by absolute purpose, its nature defined by the divine minds that dwell within it. Though the gods may gaze into the lower planes from their radiant thrones, they cannot directly enter them without unraveling the fabric of reality; their will must instead manifest through omens, avatars, emissaries, or sacred artifacts. The Aether does not echo or reflect the Material Plane, it transcends it entirely. Within its boundaries, the gods commune, contend, and shape the great metaphysical truths that ripple outward into the cosmos. Mortals who claim to have seen the Aether speak in riddles or madness, for its nature defies linear thought. There is no travel to the Aether. There is no breach, no gate, no key. It is the untouched origin, the unreachable summit, and the eternal domain of those who define the laws of existence itself.\nThe Infernum (Infernal Plane)\nThe Infernum is the plane of monstrosity, chaos, and corruption, a furnace of raw creation where demons, aberrations, and nightmare entities are born in endless, shifting violence. It is often mistaken for a version of hell, but there is no punishment or judgment here, only transformation. No souls arrive in the Infernum upon death, for in Eyum, death is the end. The Infernum is not a destination for the wicked, but a breeding ground for horrors. Its landscapes are fluid and hostile: burning chasms, bone forests, living fortresses, rivers of bile, and impossible geometries that collapse under observation. The laws of nature do not apply here, gravity shifts, time fractures, and reality itself groans under the weight of ceaseless, unnatural births. Creatures spawned here are shaped by hate, hunger, instinct, or ancient curses, never by reason. These entities sometimes claw their way into the Material Plane through unstable rifts, summoned rituals, or moments of extreme magical disruption. The Infernum is not evil in the moral sense, it is simply alien, a realm where suffering and conflict are natural forces like wind or gravity. Mortal minds that glimpse it are often broken by the sheer wrongness of its logic. While some warlocks and cursed bloodlines trace their origins to pacts formed through the Infernum, no one truly controls this place. It is the crucible of monstrosity, the raw subconscious of the cosmos, where nightmares have flesh and survival is creation’s only law.\nThe Void (Plane of Non-Being)\nThe Void is not a place in the traditional sense, it is the absence of place, a hollow expanse beyond reality where form, meaning, and existence itself unravel. It is utterly silent, airless, and lightless, untouched by time or life. There are no stars, no ground, no sky, only an endless black that neither resists nor welcomes. This is where things go when they are truly erased. Destruction spells, consumption abilities, and ancient magic that claims to “remove” something from existence do not annihilate it, they send it here. Pocket dimensions that collapse, items consumed by entropy magic, and souls severed unnaturally from all realms may fall into the Void. Once there, they drift aimlessly in an endless vacuum, stripped of context and connection. At the center of this emptiness dwells an ancient and unfathomable entity known only in whispers as The Nothing, or the Black Maw of Oblivion. It does not move or speak, but its presence is felt across the planes in moments of perfect loss. Anything it swallows ceases to be known by memory or name, and it hungers not out of malice, but as a law of its existence. Escape from the Void is nearly impossible, there are no landmarks, no gravity wells, no breathable air, and no natural exit points. But in theory, a being with sufficiently powerful magic could tear a hole in its edge and slip free, provided they are not first consumed by the Maw. Nothing grows here. Light does not carry. Even gods cannot gaze into it without risking the loss of something they did not realize they cherished. The Void is not the end. It is what comes after the end, if anything dares remain.\nThe Dreamscape (Mental Plane)\nThe Dreamscape is a surreal, ever-shifting plane formed from the collective mental energy of all living things, a subconscious overflow where thoughts, fears, memories, and imagination take on physical form. It is not entered by walking, but by slipping, through dreams, meditations, psychic ruptures, or magical accidents. Once inside, nothing follows the laws of the waking world. Geometry is unstable, time bends under emotion, and perception itself becomes a force that reshapes reality. Spells and monsters do not behave as they do elsewhere; instead, they manifest through interpretation. A fireball may erupt as a swarm of burning butterflies, or vanish entirely if the caster subconsciously doubts their control. Entities here are not born, they are believed into existence. If enough people fear something, it gains shape in the Dreamscape. If that fear persists, it gains power. Some nightmares grow so potent they develop agency and seek to influence the material world from beyond sleep. Other dream-beasts are fragments of collective guilt, longing, or wonder, drifting aimlessly until called upon by a stray thought. The plane itself resists mapping. Distance is subjective, landmarks rearrange themselves, and doors may lead to entirely different lives. The Dreamscape is beautiful and perilous, a realm where desire can heal or destroy, and where a lie believed too deeply can become a predator with teeth. It is not inherently evil, but it is profoundly dangerous. To survive here is to master your own mind, or be consumed by the minds of others.\nThe Elemental Tides\nThe Elemental Tides are a massive, planet-like plane suspended in the firmament of existence, formed entirely from pure, living elemental energy. Divided into four immense hemispheres, each quadrant represents one of the primal forces: fire, water, earth, and air. These are not symbolic territories, but overwhelming, inhospitable realms where the raw essence of each element dominates absolutely. Oceans without floor stretch endlessly in the water hemisphere, where pressure crushes intruders and beasts of salt and current roam freely. The fire hemisphere is a roaring world of magma, sunfire, and endless combustion, where flame is sentient and mountains bleed heat. The earth quadrant is a continent of moving stone, crystal caverns, and titanic beasts of iron and ore. The air domain stretches in every direction with churning winds, floating isles, thunderous vortexes, and creatures born of storm and current. At the edges where these hemispheres meet lies the most unstable region of the plane: a massive, eternal storm where the elements clash and merge violently. These borders are in constant war, earth breaks upon flame, fire is drowned by wave, water evaporates to mist, and air screams across all in a storm of chaos. Elementals summoned to the Material Plane originate from these realms, shaped by their homeland’s intensity and the will of the summoner. Each hemisphere is ruled by its respective elemental deity, beings of vast power who rarely speak and never leave their domain, content to sculpt their world in solitude or command their armies in the storm-wars along the borders. Time is unstable within the Tides, and travelers must brace against terrain that resists even magical intrusion. Nothing here was built by mortal hand, and nothing welcomes mortal presence. It is a realm of raw nature, untempered by civilization, where survival itself is a test of balance.\n5.4.1 Cross-Plane Travel\nPlane travel is rare and difficult. Most spells that interact with other planes (e.g., Summon Fiend, Planar Shift) require:\n\nGM permission\nPowerful magic \nA stable rift, ritual site, or anchor\n\nThe planes are often closer than they appear. A cursed object or an ancient temple may blur the veil between worlds. The Game Master is encouraged to use planar influence as narrative flavor or major plot threads."},"Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/5.5-Languages-(WIP)":{"slug":"Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/5.5-Languages-(WIP)","filePath":"Chapter 5 - Worldbuilding (WIP)/5.5 Languages (WIP).md","title":"5.5 Languages (WIP)","links":["Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Elvish","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Dwarvish","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Tullish","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Beast-Speech","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Auric","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Aviari","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Cheloni-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Thryzic-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Jotunic-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Ignan-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Nyxian-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Ophidian-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Mireglo-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Dragonic-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Noskaran","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Entish","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Mirrish-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Vindroth-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Serenite-(WIP)","Chapter-5---Worldbuilding-(WIP)/Languages/Xeran-(WIP)"],"tags":[],"content":"Standard Rule\nYou know:\n\nYour racial language (not all races have one)\nCommon, the shared language of most people; you know this even if your race entry doesn’t list it\n+1 bonus language per 10 Intelligence, rounded down (e.g., INT 10-19 = 1 bonus language, INT 20-29 = 2 bonus languages, etc)\n\nCommunication limits.

Case: a single monumental “capital” style—no lowercase. Glyph count: 22 letters + macron and punctuation. Tools: broad-nib or chisel; strokes prefer straights and shallow arches (no tight curves).\n2.1 Letter Set &amp; Romanization\nBelow, each entry gives a shape description (for carving/writing), name, value, and romanization. Use a square notional grid (□) to picture placement.\n\nAru — /a/ (a) — □ two verticals joined by a mid-bar; shallow roof arch.\nEru — /e/ (e) — □ single vertical with high bar and short right hook.\nIru — /i/ (i) — □ tall vertical with dot-mark above (carved as a short notch).\nOru — /o/ (o) — □ rectangle with small central void (punched square).\nUru — /u/ (u) — □ vertical with bottom bowl (flat), short right spur.\nPa — /p/ (p) — □ vertical + right half-box.\nBa — /b/ (b) — □ vertical + left half-box.\nTa — /t/ (t) — □ T-cross with lowered crossbar.\nDa — /d/ (d) — □ vertical + small diamond to right.\nKa — /k/ (k) — □ angular &lt; shape touching stem.\nGa — /g/ (g) — □ angular &gt; shape touching stem.\nFa — /f/ (f) — □ vertical with forked upper bar.\nSa — /s/ (s) — □ zig stroke centered on stem.\nSha — /ʃ/ (sh) — □ triple scratches on right of stem.\nHa — /h/ (h) — □ open gate: two posts + lintel (no fill).\nVa — /v/ (v) — □ chevron under short stem.\nZa — /z/ (z) — □ zig with tail notch.\nZha — /ʒ/ (zh) — □ triple scratches on left of stem.\nMa — /m/ (m) — □ three short uprights on common base.\nNa — /n/ (n) — □ two short uprights on common base.\nNga — /ŋ/ (ng) — □ base bar + rear hook.\nRa — /r/ (r) — □ short stem + rightward flag.\nGlides: W and Y are written with Va+Uru and Iru+y-notch respectively; in transliteration use w and y.\n\nMacron for vowel length: a straight overbar across the vowel glyph (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū). In stone, length is marked by a shallow roof cap.\n2.2 Punctuation &amp; Spacing\n\nWord divider: centered dot • (in manuscripts, a narrow space).\nClause divider: short double wedge ‹›.\nSentence end: square stop ◼.\nName marker: small triangle ˄ preceding proper names in formal inscriptions.\n\n2.3 Numerals\nDecimal system with distinct digits (□ strokes resembling stacked bars). Ordinals are written by adding a small right-flag to the numeral.\n3) Morphology\n3.1 Nouns: gender, number, case\n\nGender: animate vs inanimate (affects some pronouns and agreement).\nNumber: singular, plural, collective. Collective denotes a set treated as one (e.g., “the council”).\nCases (6): Nominative (NOM), Accusative (ACC), Genitive (GEN), Dative (DAT), Locative (LOC), Instrumental (INS).\n\nCore endings (after a consonant):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaseSingularPluralCollectiveNOM-a-im-orACC-en-em-or-enGEN-os-um-or-osDAT-ei-ein-or-eiLOC-in-ith-or-inINS-ta-tash-or-ta\nAfter a final vowel (a/e/i/o/u), drop that vowel before adding endings (e.g., luma “light” → GEN lum-os).\nAdjectives precede nouns and agree in number and case (not gender). Adjective endings mirror noun endings except GEN uses -es.\nExample: barak “mountain” (inanimate)\nNOM.SG: barak-a, GEN.SG: barak-os, LOC.PL: barak-ith.\n3.2 Pronouns (personal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonNOM.SGACC.SGGEN.SGDAT.SGNOM.PLNotes1stanmenaamosameianim“I / we”2ndtitinatiostieitim“you / you(pl)”3rd anim.sarsenasosseisim“he/she/they(anim.)”3rd inan.oroenaosoeioim“it/they(inan.)”Reflexive: sva (all persons), declines like adjective.Demonstratives: ha “this”, ka “that” (decline like adjectives).\n3.3 Determiners &amp; Articles\nNo definite/indefinite articles.

Codas limited to n/m/ng; most syllables are open.\nOnset clusters: only light pairs {pr, pl, br, bl, tr, dr, cr, cl, fr, fl}.\nStress: rhythmic—by default the final syllable carries a mild stress; tone on the main verb overrides perceived stress.\nEuphony rules: No sequence of two breathy vowels without a glide; insert y or w (e.g., āh + ī → āhyī).\n2) Script — Aeraline\nDirection: left→right. Base: 24 consonant frames + 5 standalone vowels; vowels usually appear as diacritics attached above/below consonants. Strokes: fine hairlines that thicken at stroke ends (quill “barbs”). Pitch is explicitly marked over the vowel diacritic.\n2.1 Writing pieces\n\nConsonant frames (shape cues): tall stem with gentle hooks and small end-thickenings; no sharp angles.\n\np (tall stem, looped descender), b (tall stem, closed belly), t (low stem, long roof-bar), d (rear ascender loop), c (arched fore-stroke), g (arched fore-stroke with undercurl), f (high bar + under-tail), v (shallow vee), s (flat wave), z (wave with tail), sh (triple soft comb), zh (comb reversed), h (soft gate), m (three low humps), n (two humps), ng (hump + tail), l (looped ascender), r (hooked shoulder), ny (n with y-hook), ly (l with y-hook), ch (c+i ligature), w (u-hook), y (i-hook).\n\n\nVowel marks (attached):\n\na = small over-arc; e = open over-loop; i = dot; o = under-oval; u = under-hook.\nLength = macron over/under the vowel mark; breathiness = dot below the base letter; tone = acute/grave/caron/circumflex placed above the vowel mark.\n\n\nStandalone vowels exist for word-initial vowel onsets (small independent forms on the baseline).\nLigatures: automatic CV joining; c+i → ch; l+y → ly; n+y → ny; double vowels join with a light horizontal “knot.”\nPunctuation: comma (short descender curl), clause divider (double curl), sentence end (diamond). Proper names lift the first glyph taller.\n\n3) Morphology\nAviari is fusional-light, melodic, and favors analytic strategies. No grammatical gender. Numbers: singular, dual (wing-pair), plural.\n3.1 Nouns (number &amp; light case)\nNumber suffixes: -të (dual), -in (plural).\nCases: Nominative (—), Accusative (— / by position), Genitive -el/-il (harmonizes), Dative -ir, Locative -na, Ablative -or, Instrumental -së (soft).\n\nAfter vowel stems, drop the stem vowel before -el/-ir/-na/-or/-së.\nGenitive -el fronts to -il after front vowels (e, i, ë, ü).\nAdjectives follow nouns and agree in number (add -të/-in) but not in case:\nanel-in lóra-in “bright stars,” anel-të lóra-të “two bright stars.”\nDefiniteness via demonstratives: ha “this,” ke “that,” placed before the NP.\n\n3.2 Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonNOMACCGENDAT1sgenmenmelmir2sgtitintiltir3sgsesenselsir1duentëmentëmeltëmirtë3dusetësentëseltësirtë1plemmemmilmirë2pltemtemnteltirë3plsersennsilsirë\nReflexive së behaves like an adjective (agrees in number).\n3.3 Derivation\n\nAgentive -ar (mor “fly, go” → mor-ar “flier”), Abstract -eth, Diminutive -el, Augmentative -orë, Collective -thir.\nSound-symbolic -ril adds “trilling/lively” nuance to verbs or nouns (lóra-ril “bright, shimmering”).\n\n4) Verbs\nAviari uses both morphology and tone. Conjugation is lighter than Elvish; tone on the main verb encodes mood by default.\n4.1 Categories\n\nTense: Present, Past, Future.\nAspect: Imperfective (IPFV), Perfective (PFV).\nMood (default by tone):\n\nDeclarative: Mid tone on main verb (ā/ē/ī/ō/ū).\nImperative/Directive: High (á/é/í/ó/ú).\nYes/No Question: Rising (ǎ/ě/ǐ/ǒ/ǔ) or particle qa.\nFinal/Emphatic Affirmation: Falling (â/ê/î/ô/û).\nPolite/Soft: Low (à/è/ì/ò/ù) often with sentence-initial la.\n\n\nVoice: Active (zero), Middle -ri-, Passive -en (participle) with auxiliary.\nAgreement: SG/DU/PL via person endings; pro-drop common.\n\n4.2 Personal endings\nAttach after the tense/aspect vowel (or bare stem in simple present).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonSGDUPL1-n-ntë-m2-th-thë-thë3-s-së-r\n4.3 Tense/Aspect formatives\n\nPresent: theme vowel -a- (often zero if euphonic).\nPast: -e- (PFV) or -na- (IPFV).\nFuture: -i-.\nPerfect (resultative): auxiliary esë + past participle -en.\n\nTemplate: stem-(aspect/tense)-(voice)-person, with tone applied to the vowel of the finite verb.\n4.4 Negation &amp; Modality\n\nNegation: hu immediately before the verb; the verb takes Low tone: hu làr-a-n “I do not speak.”\nProhibitive: ma + infinitive: ma larë!\nSubjunctive: particle me before the verb or suffix -ir after the tense vowel: me lará-s / lar-a-ir-s.\n\n4.5 Non-finite forms\n\nInfinitive: -ë; Gerund: -iel; Active Participle: -el; Past Participle: -en.\n\n4.6 Conjugation examples\nLet lar- “speak,” mor- “fly/go,” ven- “see.”\nPresent (IND, Mid tone):\n\n1sg larān “I speak”\n3pl morār “they fly”\n\nPast PFV (IND, Mid tone):\n\n1sg laren “I spoke”\n2pl moren-thë “you (pl) went/flew”\n\nPast IPFV (IND):\n\n3sg lar-na-s “he/she was speaking”\n\nFuture (IND):\n\n1du mor-i-ntë “we two will fly”\n\nImperative (High tone):\n\n2sg lár-a-th! “speak!”\n\nYes/No (Rising tone)\n\n3sg morǎ-s? “does he/she fly?”\n\nPassive (analytic)\n\nesë laren “(it) is spoken”\n\nMiddle\n\nmor-ri-a-n “I fly for myself / set out”\n\n5) Syntax\n5.1 Word order\nDefault SVO.

Clusters are limited to soft onsets: {pr, pl, br, bl, tr, dr, cr, cl, fr, fl}. Codas favor nasals and liquids: {m, n, ng, l, r, s}.Stress: default final syllable; if the final syllable is light (short vowel, no coda) and the penult is heavy (long vowel or coda), stress shifts to penult. In compounds, each member keeps its stress.\n2) Script — Lethiril Cursive\nDirection: left→right. Base set: 28 letters. Style: fast connected cursive with looped ascenders/descenders; most vowels surface as attached diacritics over/under a consonant frame, but stand-alone vowel letters exist. Words prefer continuous ligature chains.\n2.1 Letter inventory &amp; romanization\nConsonant frames (ink stroke cues in italics):\n\na (standalone vowel; small loop on baseline)\ne (standalone vowel; open loop with top tick)\ni (upright hairline with dot)\no (oval loop)\nu (bowl with trailing hook)\np (tall stem, open loop descender)\nb (tall stem, closed loop descender)\nt (short stem, long overbar)\nd (short stem, rear loop ascender)\nc (curved fore-stroke; before front vowels forms ch-shape)\ng (arched stem with undercurl)\nf (long overbar, under-tail)\nv (shallow vee with high join)\ns (flat wave)\nz (zig with soft under-tail)\nsh (triple hairline comb)\nzh (triple hairline comb reversed)\nh (gate—two posts, light lintel)\nm (three humps on a low line)\nn (two humps)\nng (hump + tail)\nl (looped ascender)\nr (hooked shoulder, short tail)\nny (n with high y-hook)\nly (l with high y-hook)\nch (special ligature of c+i; looks like tall curved hook)\nj (arched hook with dot; rare)\nw/y (both written as joining marks; w = u-hook; y = i-hook)\n\nVowel marks (when attached):\n\na = small over-arc; e = open over-loop; i = dot; o = under-oval; u = under-hook; ë = double over-dot; ü = tiny over-circle.\nLength: acute accent over the vowel mark (á, é, í, ó, ú, ḗ, ǘ).\n\nLigatures: CV joins are automatic (c+i→ch, l+y→ly, n+y→ny). Double vowels in hiatus form a horizontal knot between letters.\nPunctuation: word space is narrow; comma is short descender curl; clause divider is double comma; sentence end is a diamond; proper names begin with a taller initial glyph.\n3) Morphology\nElvish is fusional with smooth vocalic endings. No grammatical gender. Numbers: singular, dual, plural.\n3.1 Nouns (number &amp; case)\nCases: Nominative (NOM), Accusative (ACC), Genitive (GEN), Dative (DAT), Locative (LOC), Ablative (ABL), Instrumental (INS).\nBase endings (after consonant-final stems):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaseSingularDualPluralNOM-a-të-inACC-en-tën-inënGEN-el-tel-ilDAT-ir-tir-irëLOC-na-tëna-inëABL-or-tëor-uriINS-thë-tëthë-ithëAfter a final vowel, drop that vowel before adding -a/-en/-el etc. Dual -të sits before other case endings: sel-të-el “of the pair of stars.”\nAdjectives follow nouns and agree in number (not case). Adjective plural uses -in; dual uses -të: lóra anel-in “bright stars,” lóra anel-të “the two bright stars.”\nDefiniteness: analytic, with demonstratives: ha “this,” ke “that,” placed before the noun phrase: ha lórin anel-in “these bright stars.”\n3.2 Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonNOMACCGENDAT1sgenmenmelmir2sgtitintiltir3sgsesenselsir1plemmemmilmirë2pltemtemnteltirë3plsersennsilsirë1duentëmentëmeltëmirtë2dutitëtintëtiltëtirtë3dusetësentëseltësirtëReflexive së (all persons) behaves like an adjective (agrees in number).Interrogatives: mi who, mae what, kath where, len when, sai why, kya how.\n3.3 Determination &amp; Possession\n\nGenitive after the head: anel-a sel “the star of her.”\nAlternatively, analytic na “of” may be used for clarity or poetics: anel-a na sel.\n\n3.4 Derivation\n\nAgentive -ar (mor “travel” → mor-ar “traveler”).\nAbstract -eth (lóra “bright” → lór-eth “brightness”).\nDiminutive -el, augmentative -orë, collective -thir.\n\n3.5 Harmony &amp; Euphony\nVowel harmony is optional but preferred in formal style: suffix vowels assimilate toward the nearest stem vowel (front vs back). Thus GEN on a stem with front vowels may surface as -il rather than -el.\n3.6 Palatalization (softening)\nBefore front vowels (e i ë ü) or y, the consonants soften:\n\nc (/k/) → ch (/t͡ʃ/): cal “stone” → chelin (PL GEN).\nt → alveolo-palatal [t̠ʃ] written ch in some dialects; literary standard keeps t but writes an i-hook.\nn + y → ny, l + y → ly, d + y → j in careful speech.\n\n4) Verbs\n4.1 Overview\nElvish is pro-drop (subject pronouns optional). Verbs conjugate for person/number, tense, aspect, and mood. Voice is analytic (passive with auxiliary + participle).\n\nTense: Present, Past, Future.\nAspect: Imperfective (IPFV), Perfective (PFV).\nMood: Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative.\nAgreement: 1/2/3 × SG/DU/PL.\n\n4.2 Personal endings (attach after tense/aspect vowel)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonSGDUPL1-n-ntë-m2-th-thë-thë3-s-së-r\n4.3 Tense/Aspect formatives\n\nPresent: theme vowel -a- (bare stem if euphonic).\nPast: -e- (PFV) or -na- (IPFV).\nFuture: -i-.\nPerfect (resultative): -ó- + participle.\n\nTemplate: stem-(aspect/tense)-(voice)-person.\n4.4 Voice &amp; Non-finite forms\n\nPassive: auxiliary esë “to be” + past participle -en: esë laren “is spoken.”\nMiddle/reflexive: infix -ri- before the personal ending: laira-ri-s “she speaks for herself.”\nInfinitive: -ë; Gerund: -iel; Active Participle: -el; Past Participle: -en.\n\n4.5 Negation &amp; Modality\n\nNegation: particle ui directly before the verb: ui lara-n “I do not speak.”\nProhibitive: ui + infinitive: ui larë! “do not speak!”\nSubjunctive: particle me before the verb or suffix -ir after the tense vowel: me lara-s / lar-a-ir-s “that she speak.”\n\n4.6 Conjugation examples\nLet lar- “speak,” mel- “love,” mor- “go.”\nPresent (IND):\n\n1sg lar-a-n “I speak”\n3sg mel-a-s “he/she loves”\n3pl mor-a-r “they go”\n\nPast PFV (IND):\n\n1sg lar-e-n “I spoke”\n3du mel-e-së “the two loved”\n2pl mor-e-thë “you (pl) went”\n\nPast IPFV (IND):\n\n1pl lar-na-m “we were speaking”\n3sg mel-na-s “he/she was loving”\n\nFuture (IND):\n\n2sg lar-i-th “you will speak”\n3pl mel-i-r “they will love”\n\nPerfect (resultative):\n\n3sg lar-ó-en esë (lit. “is spoken”) → esë laren in analytic word order.\n\nImperative:\n\n2sg lar-a!\n2pl lar-ië!

This also applies to any other element that is not listed.\n\nAffinity scaling:\n\nIn early levels, Generic Affinity spells tend to be more powerful, as negative modifiers in other Affinity types weaken their respective spells.\nIn later levels, specialized Affinities become much stronger due to their stacking potential.\n\nAccuracy\nSpell Attack Bonus = Spellcasting Modifier (from class) + Total Affinity Modifier (related to the spell)\nWhen casting a spell that requires an attack roll, the caster rolls 1d20 + their total Affinity Modifier + their Spellcasting Modifier (based on class). The result is compared to the target’s Armor Class (AC). If the result is equal to or greater than the target’s AC, the spell hits.\nEach spellcaster class uses a specific Spellcasting Modifier:\n\nWizard, Energyweaver- Intelligence\nCleric, Druid, Runemaster, Ranger - Wisdom\nWarlock, Sorcerer, Bard, Paladin - Charisma\nOthers (Fighter, Rogue, etc.) - Will rarely use spells but use their Wisdom Modifier as the default.\n\nGenerally speaking the physical classes can only cast spells if you multiclass with a magical class, in that case you would use that class’s spellcasting modifier for your spells.\n\n\n\nWhen multiclassing you can choose which modifier to use based on which class you have the most levels in, if the classes are tied then you get to choose. \nThe Affinity Modifier is determined by the spell’s elemental components. You always add:\n\nThe Affinity linked to the spell’s element (e.g., Fire Affinity for a fire spell)\nYour Generic Affinity (which applies to all spells)\n\nExample:\nA Wizard casting a Fire spell has:\n\nIntelligence Modifier: +3\nFire Affinity: -2\nGeneric Affinity: +1\nTheir total bonus is (+3 - 2 + 1) = +2.\nThey roll a d20 and add +2 to determine if the spell hits the target’s AC.\n\nConcentration\nSome spells require a caster to maintain their focus over multiple turns. These are known as Concentration Spells. Maintaining concentration on such spells can be disrupted by distractions or attacks, requiring the caster to succeed on regular concentration saves.\nConcentration Mechanics:\n\nConcentration Check:\nAt the start of each of the caster’s turns while maintaining a concentration spell, they must succeed on a Concentration Save or the spell immediately ends.\nConcentration Save DC: 15\nCalculating Concentration Saves: Roll 1d20 + Affinity Modifier of the spell being concentrated on.\nConcentration and Damage: Whenever the caster takes damage while concentrating, they must immediately make an additional concentration save (DC 15). If the caster fails this save, concentration is broken, and the spell ends immediately.\nIf you cast another spell that requires concentration it immediately ends the previously concentrated on spell.\n\nUpcasting Spells\nMost spells in Eyum can be upcast, allowing spellcasters to increase their potency at the cost of significantly higher Mana consumption. Upcasting generally becomes less mana efficient the more times it is done making it more efficient in the long run to cast many spells instead of a large upcasted spell. \nWhat Can Be Upcast?\nMost damage-dealing spells can be upcast, typically increasing:\n\nDamage output (e.g., a fireball dealing more damage).\nNumber of projectiles (e.g., magic missiles launching additional bolts).\nArea of effect (e.g., an explosion covering a larger radius).\nDuration (e.g., spells lasting more turns or minutes).\n\nSome spells may not have an upcast option if their effect cannot reasonably scale. If a spell does not list an upcast effect, it cannot be upcast. Always refer to the Spellbook for specific spell interactions.\nDetecting Magic\nYou may attempt to detect the presence of magic in an object, in an area, or on a person/creature. To do so you must make an Arcana check, the DC will be determined by the GM based on how obviously magical the thing is. Once you know that magic is there you may do another arcana check to attempt to learn more about the magic, what kind of magic it is, what it will do, etc. The GM may not allow you to make this check if your character is not learned in magic (has no levels in magical classes).\nMana/Energy\nAll spell-casters possess a Mana Pool, which represents their available magical energy. The size of this pool is determined by class and increases with level.\n\nWhen casting a spell, a large portion of Mana is consumed upon activation.\n\nThere are three primary ways to recover Mana:\n\nShort Rest - Resting for 1 hour restores 50% of total Mana.\nLong Rest - Sleeping for 8 hours restores all lost Mana.\nMana Potions - Consuming potions can restore instant Mana, depending on the potion’s strength.\n"},"Chapter-6---Magic-and-Abilities/6.1-Magic-Systems/6.1.3-Alchemy-(WIP)":{"slug":"Chapter-6---Magic-and-Abilities/6.1-Magic-Systems/6.1.3-Alchemy-(WIP)","filePath":"Chapter 6 - Magic and Abilities/6.1 Magic Systems/6.1.3 Alchemy (WIP).md","title":"6.1.3 Alchemy (WIP)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Alchemy in Eyum is not a form of spellcasting but rather an advanced craft that harnesses chemical and elemental reactions to produce potions, powders, gels, and other alchemical concoctions.

Spells will carry most of the specificity; this section defines only the universal rules your class and those spells rely on.\nCosts, Cap, and Casting\n\nMana Cost: Energymancy has Mana Cost 0.\nTransfer Cap (Throughput): Per casting you may move up to TP = your current Mana.\nAction Economy: Unless a spell says otherwise, Energymancy takes 1 Action.\nAttack/Save Defaults:\n\nSpell Attack = INT mod + Proficiency + relevant Subclass Affinity (never add Generic).\nSave DC = 10 + INT mod + Proficiency + relevant Subclass Affinity.\n\n\n\nSource, Target, Sink (Conservation)\n\nSource: where energy comes from (creature, object, area, phenomenon).\nTarget: where the primary effect applies (may equal Source for equalization).\nSink: where displaced energy goes (ground, air, metal, coolant, capacitor, living target, you, etc.).\nValidity. A casting is illegal and has no effect if you cannot name a legal Source and a legal Sink for all TP you intend to move.\n\nPer-Type Baselines (per 1 TP moved)\nBaseline magnitude when you use Basic Transfer (spells may override):\n\nThermal: 1d4 fire (adding heat) or 1d4 cold (removing heat).\nKinetic: 1d6 bludgeoning.\nChemical: 1 TP stored or dumped; if dumped as damage then half of the damage will be Fire and the other half with be Force.\nGravitational: 1d6 force.\nSonic: 1d4 force.\nElectromagnetic: 1d6 lightning or 1d6 radiant (light).\nVitalic: +1 Vitality, +1 Health, or +1 Mana.\n\nMedia &amp; Range (the important part)\nAt SL 1 in any subclass you must touch both the Source and the Target.\nAs SL increases you gain range via media the energy can travel through. Metal is easy, air is hard. Ranges below refer to the length of the total path from you to the Source/Target/Sink along a valid medium. “Joints” are the number of times the medium changes (bar → water tank → pipe = 2 joints).\nThermal\n\nSL 1: Touch both ends.\nSL 2: Metal only, ≤10 ft, 0 joints.\nSL 3: Metal/Water, ≤30 ft, 1 joint.\nSL 4: Metal/Water/Stone, ≤60 ft, 2 joints.\nSL 5: Metal/Water/Stone/Wood/Earth, ≤120 ft, 3 joints.\nAir is not a valid Thermal medium by default; specific spells may allow it.\n\nKinetic\n\nSL 1: Touch both ends.\nSL 2: Continuous rigid path ≤10 ft, 0 joints.\nSL 3: Rigid path ≤30 ft, 1 joint.\nSL 4: Rigid path ≤60 ft, 2 joints.\nSL 5: Rigid path ≤120 ft, 3 joints.\nAir/Ground is not a valid Kinetic medium by default; specific spells may allow it.\n\nChemical\nNote for GMs: Due to the nature of this SL it is recommended to use the Carrying Capacity rules if you have a player using the Chemical subclass.\n\nRule. Chemical energy can be stored in non-living objects. Each object has a TP storage limit; if you exceed that limit during storage, the object explodes immediately.\nExplosion radius: stored TP × 0.1 ft (round up to the nearest foot).\nExplosion damage: use the Per-Type Baselines for the energy type stored. When an object explodes it is destroyed leaving little to nothing behind unless the object is magical or enchanted in which case the energy will be released but the object will not be destroyed.\nIntentional release: Intentionally releasing the energy can be done in one of two ways:\n\nExplosive - Instantly explode all the energy stored in an object, follows the same rules as an overload.\nSiphon - Siphon some energy out of the object and convert it into something else.\n\n\nScaling: Storage scales with Chemical SL, for each level in Chemical SL you may multiply the TP per lb by 2. For example, Stone has a TP per lb of 1.0 so you can store 1 TP for each lb of stone at a Chemical SL of 1. At Chemical SL 2 you can now store 2 TP per 1 lbs of stone and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterialTP per lbCloth / Rope0.3Cloudcap Spores0.3Leather0.4Crimsonveil Spore0.4Gravegill Cluster0.4Vireleaf0.4Plastic0.5Aetherveil Bloom0.5Noctiluven0.5Bone0.6Harori0.6Voidsand0.6Rubber0.7Fellroot Mantle0.7Mycoflare Cap0.7Pula Morris0.7Oil0.8Glass0.8Wood0.8Ceramic0.9Dirt / Loose Soil1.0Stone1.0Packed Earth / Clay1.1Brick / Concrete1.1Crystal / Quartz1.1Canyonstar Dust1.1Water1.2Echostone1.2Sweltrine1.2Aluminum1.3Seron1.3Graphite / Carbon Rod1.4Pyrotalus1.4Lightnum1.5Rumblestone1.5Copper / Bronze1.6Silver1.6Eclipticorbs1.6Lead1.7Gold1.7Ferroflux1.7Iron1.8Moltenheart1.9Steel2.0Phoenixscale2.2Nerite Dust2.5\nGravitational\n\nRequires an anchor point you can see.\nAnchor range: SL 1: touch; SL 2: 10 ft; SL 3: 30 ft; SL 4: 60 ft; SL 5: 120 ft.\nMass limits are on the subclass (see class page).\n\nSonic (needs a medium)\n\nSL 1: Touch both ends through a solid.\nSL 2: Air/Water straight line ≤10 ft.\nSL 3: ≤30 ft, 1 bend around an opening.\nSL 4: ≤60 ft, 2 bends; thin wood attenuates but allows passage.\nSL 5: ≤120 ft, 3 bends; dense stone/metal significantly attenuate or block unless a spell says otherwise.\n\nElectromagnetic\n\nElectricity: Use Path Difficulty (PD) and SL check: you can conduct only if SL ≥ PD.\n\nPD chart: Metal 0, Brine 1, Fresh Water 2, Flesh/Wet Wood 3, Dry Wood 4, Stone 5, Air 6.\nRange: SL 1 touch; SL 2: 10 ft (PD 0); SL 3: 30 ft (PD ≤2); SL 4: 60 ft (PD ≤4); SL 5: 120 ft (PD ≤6).\nIf multiple paths exist, current takes the lowest PD path; only spells may override this.\n\n\nLight: Line of sight only.

This is a reference section, not a reading assignment. Spellcasters only need to read the spells they can access based on their class and level. Use this section to find options and copy down relevant spell details onto your sheet.\nMany spells exist in multiple versions, meaning that while they share the same name, their effects and Mana costs may vary depending on the class that learns them. \nWhen learning a new spell, you may choose to learn a Generic spell instead of a class-specific one. Generic Spells are universally accessible and function the same regardless of which class learns them.\nBelow is a list of all spells currently in the TRPG (WIP); This is not currently complete at all, I am still debating the format for the descriptions and I am missing many of the spells.\nBard Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameManaDescriptionBallad of Warding16Aura that grants resistance to a chosen damage type.Chain Chorus18A striking note leaps between foes in quick succession.Chord of Comfort12A soothing chord that restores an ally and steadies their guard.Clear the Stage12Scrubs away a poison, disease, or a curse from a target.Courier Sprite8Summons a tiny spectral courier to deliver a small item or message.Crescendo Burst20A burst of sound that batters creatures in a small area.Curtain of Spotlights8Either flood an area with bright revealing light or cloak it in magical darkness.Echo Ensemble26Conjures two untouchable echo-performers that harry nearby foes.Encore Link10Brief telepathic link with a willing creature.Eyes of the Audience10Grants sight of the invisible and sharpens visual perception.Fanfare Blast14A conic blast of sound that can deafen those it strikes.Field of Needles18A bristling sonic field that slows movement and injures trespassers.Finale of Glory25A triumphant flourish that heals allies and bolsters their defense.Grand Illusion28Creates a large, convincing illusion that can seem to interact with the world.Harmonic Ray16A cutting line of resonant force.Harmonic Ward12A personal buffer that absorbs incoming harm.Mask of the Maestro8Adopts a convincing disguise—appearance and voice.Murmuration of Notes18A swirling flock of spectral notes that harms and throws off attackers.Needle of Dissonance16A piercing sonic strike that hinders the target’s next attack.Ovation of the Unbowed28Rallying ovation that fortifies allies and can keep them on their feet.Rattle of the Snare14Rapid percussive bolts that can be split among targets.Reprise Push10A forceful cadence that shoves a creature away.Resonant Cut10A close-range sonic slash that lets you slip aside.Resonant Locator12Sense the direction to a known creature or once-held object nearby.Rhythm of Haste10Quickens allies’ step and sharpens their initiative.Spectral Instrument2Conjures an instrument-weapon that can strike as you perform.Step of the Stage12A short blink to a space you can see.Stinging Note12A sharp note that stings and robs a foe of reactions briefly.Tempo Snare18Snags a foe’s momentum, slowing and limiting its movement.Veil of Applause12A heavy sonic haze for cover and quick hiding.Wall of Sound24An impenetrable barrier of resonant force that blocks passage and line of effect.Withering Refrain16A decaying dirge that withers a target over time.\nCleric Spells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameManaDescriptionAegis of Light12Personal radiant ward that absorbs incoming damage.Angel’s Wings16Bestows swift flight upon the blessed.Blessing of Resolve12Aura that steadies allies with better saves and protection.Brand of Penance16Imposes a searing mark that punishes and weakens a foe.Chains of Faith16Holy bindings that halt movement and bar teleportation.Consecrated Touch10Melee strike of sanctified power that also blocks healing briefly.Daybreak8Floods an area with bright light, suppressing lesser darkness.Divine Augury6Reads nearby magic and senses consecrated or desecrated places.Divine Mending4Mends wounds at a touch and stops bleeding.Dome of Faith24Radiant dome that blocks passage and line of effect.Hallowed Ground18Sanctifies terrain;

From this point every 2 levels of effective Runemaster Level raises the maximum by 1.\n\nRune Knowledge\n\nIf and Than runes are always known and do not count against total runes known.\n\nUsing Xeran as Effect Payloads\nVindroth can call Xeran runes as effect payloads (usually to define damage type / element / output).\nExample structure:\n\nIf object (human) entered size (5) shape (sphere) Than Power (Xeran Fire)\nTo increase output, you may repeat effect runes:\n… Than Power (Xeran Fire) And Power (Xeran Fire)\nWith each And Power adding another damage as well as consuming 1 Structure Limit\n\nVindroth Conditionals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuneEffectIfBegins a conditional check.ThanExecutes the next statement(s) if the condition is true.ElseExecutes the next statement(s) if the previous condition was false (may be followed by If).AndCombines conditions/effects; both must apply (when used with If) or both occur (when used with effects).OrCombines conditions; either condition being true is sufficient.NotNegates a condition (true only if the condition is not met).atSpecifies the point of origin / location where the effect occurs.whileKeeps the effect active as long as the condition remains true.sizeDefines area size; maximum area is 5 × Vindroth School Level.shapeDefines area shape (sphere, cube, spear (directional attack)).objectDefines what is being checked or targeted (leave blank to mean “any”).withinTrue if the object is within the specified range/area.enteredTrue if the object enters the specified range/area.valueStores a named value (variable).equalsTrue if two values are equal.greaterTrue if the first value is greater than the second.lesserTrue if the first value is less than the second.hasTrue if the object has a specified property/flag/mark.lacksTrue if the object lacks a specified property/flag/mark.selfTrue if the object is the caster.touchedTrue if the inscribed surface is touched.movedTrue if the object moved.attackedTrue if the object attacked.damagedTrue if the object took damage.healedTrue if the object was healed.castTrue if the object casts a spell.chanceRoll 1d10 and return the number (usable with comparisons like greater/lesser/equals).directionSpecifies a direction (up/down/north/south/east/west).

Nerite allows +1 Max Rune Tier on that item.\nTool perks: Ferroflux Kit Frame −2, Canyonstar plate −1, Runesmith’s Chisel: advantage or −2.\n\nSuccess: rune sits, immediate effect.\nFail by 1–4: no slot consumed; you may try again after 1 hour.\nFail by 5+ (Surge): roll Enchant Mishap d12 (below). The attempt consumes 50% of the rune’s catalyst value.\nTime: Each engraving attempt takes 1 hour per rune tier (T1=1h, T3=3h, etc.).\nC) Overload &amp; Stabilizers\nGoing over the item’s Rune Cap adds +4 DC per extra rune and risks Overload each long rest: roll Arcana DC 15 + 2×(excess runes). On fail, one random rune goes dormant for 24h and the item takes Stress (−1 to Engrave attempts on it) until repaired (1 hour, DC 12).\nStabilizers (consumed on use):\n\nEclipticorb: negate one Mishap roll or remove two Stress stacks from the item.\nCanyonstar powder (trace): −1 Engrave DC for this attempt (stacks once).\nFerroflux paste: allows moving a socketed rune to a new slot on the same item without re-rolling (once per item/day).\n\nD) Enchant Mishap (d12)\n1 Backfeed: you take 2d6 Force; rune fails.\n2 Scorch lines: +2 Engrave DC on this item for 24h.\n3 Polarity flip: rune inverts for 1 hour (e.g., Fire → Cold).\n4 Dormant: all runes on this item disable for 10 minutes.\n5 Hairline lattice: −1 Rune Cap until repaired (1h DC 14).\n6 Wild spark: trigger a random Tier-1 rune effect in 10 ft (GM pick from your lists).\n7 Anchoring slip: rune sits but at −1 to its DC/attack until re-set (1h DC original −2).\n8 Overheat: you gain 1 Exhaustion unless CON 14.\n9 Bleedthrough: nearby ally takes 1d6 of the rune’s damage type (if any).\n10 Static lock: you cannot attempt engraving for 1 hour.\n11 Rune drift: rune shifts slot; if no free slot, it pops out (salvage 50%).\n12 Minor fizzle: nothing happens; you may immediately retry at +2 DC or stop.\nE) Direct Infusions (permanent passives)\nInstead of a standard rune, you can stitch a Catalyst into the frame (e.g., Phoenixscale, Moltenheart, Voidsand). Use Craft(INT) with Alchemist Kit or Arcana with Enchanter’s Kit (your choice).\n\nInfusion DC = 12 + Material Engrave Mod + Item Magic Step\nTime = 2 hours (Phoenixscale/Moltenheart), 3 hours (Voidsand), 4 hours (Nerite channel), unless the catalyst says otherwise.\nEffect examples:\n• Phoenixscale: Fire Resistance (armor) or +1d4 Fire (weapons, 1/turn).\n• Moltenheart: Ignite on crit (weapons) or +1 Fire AC (armor).\n• Voidsand: −1 to incoming spell attack rolls vs wearer; enables Anti-Magic rune without extra DC.\n• Nerite Dust (bound): +1 Max Rune Tier on this item (stacks once).\n• Echostone shard (bedded): armor echoes a triggered rune once/encounter at half effect.\n\nFail by 5+: roll Enchant Mishap.\nF) Disenchanting &amp; Salvage\n\nPop a Rune: Runebinder’s Needle (1/day, no roll) or Arcana DC 15 + Rune Tier; success salvages the rune intact; fail by 5+ loses it (50% catalyst back).\nGrind to Dust: spend 1 hour; regain 50–75% of the catalyst value; frame unaffected.\nStrip a Frame: to reuse a Nerite/Voidsand frame, spend 2 hours, DC 15; success clears Stress and residual enchantment trace.\n\nTime, Costs, and Materials\nMaterial Units (MU): abstracted weight/volume of the main metal/medium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrameMULight weapon / small tool2 MUOne-handed weapon / shield / medium tool4 MUTwo-handed weapon / large tool8 MULight armor suit6 MUMedium armor suit10 MUHeavy armor suit14 MU\n\nRarity surcharge (if the blueprint itself is rarer than mundane): Uncommon +25% MU, Rare +50%, Very Rare +75%, Legendary custom/quest.\nCosts: If you track coin, price each MU of material by scarcity (Copper 1, Bronze 2, Iron 3, Steel 5, Silver 15, Gold 50, Runewood 6, Obsidian 4, Echostone 20, Canyonstar 25, Voidsand 60, Phoenixscale 80, Moltenheart 80, Nerite 120).

Players generally don’t need to read this section, these stat blocks are used by the GM. If you’re curious about how monsters are built or want to design your own later, you can revisit this part. If you want a general understanding just read through 8.1 and 8.2.1-8.2.2.\nMonsters in The World of Eyum are the creatures, entities, and horrors that populate the world. They range from wild animals and corrupted abominations to celestial beings and eldritch horrors. Monsters serve as adversaries, obstacles, and even potential allies, depending on the context of an encounter.\nMonsters in Eyum follow the same core mechanics as player characters but are built differently, using simplified stat blocks for ease of play. Their attributes, abilities, and behavior depend on their lore, classification, and purpose within an encounter.\nBelow is a list of all monsters currently in the TTRPG; This is very much a WIP and likely missing half of the monsters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNameCRDescriptionGoat0Goats are agile, sure-footed animals with curved horns, rough coats, and rectangular pupils.

Unlike players, monsters do not use traditional classes, feats, or leveling systems. Instead, their stat blocks are designed based on their Challenge Rating (CR) and role in battle.\nTurn Structure\n\nInitiative: Monsters roll Initiative and take turns like any other combatant.\nActions &amp; Abilities: Monsters take their turn, using abilities, attacks, and reactions based on their stat block.\nVitality &amp; Health: Monsters typically have Vitality (Vit) acting as temporary stamina before they start taking actual Health (HP) damage.\nDefenses &amp; Resistances: Many monsters have unique resistances, vulnerabilities, or immunities to elements, physical attacks, or status effects.\n\nAttack Types\nMonsters attack using one or more of the following methods:\n\nMelee Attacks: Claws, bites, weapons, tentacles, etc.\nRanged Attacks: Spit, thrown weapons, projectiles, breath weapons.\nMagic &amp; Abilities: Some creatures cast spells, use auras, or have unique supernatural effects.\nReactions &amp; Legendary Actions: Some powerful monsters can act outside their turn, responding to player actions with counterattacks or defensive moves.\n\nThreat Scaling &amp; Challenge Ratings (CR)\nMonsters are categorized by Challenge Rating (CR) to determine their difficulty:\n\nCR 1-5: Low-level creatures, minor threats, small beasts.\nCR 6-10: Mid-level threats, dangerous beasts, trained warriors, lesser demons.\nCR 11-15: Advanced creatures, powerful warlords, lesser eldritch horrors.\nCR 16-20: Near-boss-tier monsters, divine beings, demon lords, ancient dragons.\nCR 21+ (Legendary/Boss-Level): World-ending threats, supreme eldritch entities.\n\n8.1.3 Pacts?\nIf a monster has a CR of 15+ then a warlock can form a pact with it, the abilities you will gain from this pact will be much weaker than a deity pact but will still allow you to take warlock levels without using deities.

Some may be weakened by age, curse, or damage. Others may be empowered by divine favor, magical mutations, or simply the rigors of survival. To accommodate greater flexibility and narrative depth in encounter design, monsters may be modified using variant modifiers.\nThese modifiers allow a GM to scale a monster’s Combat Rating (CR) up or down to match the challenge level of a party, regardless of its base species or intended threat. This system is ideal for adapting lower-level monsters into high-level fights or using powerful creatures in weakened states.\nEach modifier adjusts the creature’s stats, abilities, and CR to reflect its enhanced or diminished power. These changes are applied after the base statblock has been created, and may be combined with creature leveling (see 8.2.2).\nImportant: A monster’s species does not limit its potential power. These modifiers provide mechanical support for scaling threats while maintaining consistency with the creature’s origin and lore.\nVariant Modifiers Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifierCR ChangeMechanical ChangesLesser-2-20% HP/Vitality, -2 to all stats, -1 attack/damage rolls, loses 1 special ability (if applicable).Weakened-1-10% HP/Vitality, -1 to all stats, loses legendary actions if any.Cursed-1Immune to healing, gains one random debuff (e.g., frightened at start of combat), -1 to all saving throws.Standard±0No change from base statblock.Elite+1+10% HP/Vitality, +1 to all stats, one extra use of a limited ability.Greater+2+25% HP/Vitality, +2 to all stats, gains a minor passive effect (e.g., regenerate 2 HP/turn).Mythic+3+50% HP/Vitality, +3 to all stats, gains a second phase at 0 HP (returns at half HP).Ancient+3+60% HP/Vitality, immune to 1 damage type, gains +2 AC, +2 to saving throws, +1 ApCorrupted+2+75% HP/Vitality, Deals +1d8 necrotic/psychic damage on all attacks, but takes +25% damage from radiant.Awakened+4+100% HP, +4 to all stats, +2 ApUsing Variant Modifiers\n\nApplication: Apply modifiers before a combat encounter. They are not intended to fluctuate mid-battle.\nStacking: Only one modifier should be applied per monster.\nNarrative Use: Encourage flavor integration. A Greater Vintershade might be the clan leader.\n\n8.2.2* Monster Leveling\nWhile Challenge Rating (CR) determines a monster’s base threat, GMs may sometimes want to feature familiar monsters at higher or lower threat levels without replacing their species. The Monster Leveling system provides a flexible method to scale existing monsters up or down while preserving their identity and narrative role.\nThis allows a CR 3 creature like a Mirewretch to reappear as a CR 13 version in a higher-tier adventure, using expanded stats and more dangerous abilities.\nNote: This system is optional and should be used alongside 8.2.1 Variant Modifiers when appropriate. It does not replace the core CR guidelines used for stat creation and balance.\nHow It Works\nMonster Leveling adjusts a creature’s CR by reassigning stats, recalculating HP/Vitality, and optionally granting additional abilities. This does not alter the monster’s core behavior or species traits, it simply reflects a more powerful or weakened version of the same creature archetype.\nWhen leveling a monster:\n\nUse the monster’s current CR as a base.\nApply the new CR’s stat block ranges as defined in 8.2 Step 2 (Strength, Dexterity, etc.).\nRecalculate HP and Vitality using the CR-appropriate formulas from Step 3.\nIncrease damage output and ability scaling in accordance with Step 4’s CR guidelines.\nAdjust AC, resistances, and number of abilities if desired to match the new power level.\n\nDesign Notes\n\nWhen leveling a monster, treat it as a “template” that gets rebuilt with higher CR values, not as a simple numerical scaling.\nYou may add new abilities, legendary actions, or passives as the CR rises, but keep the monster’s core theme intact.\nIf used in combination with 8.2.1 Variant Modifiers, apply modifiers after leveling is complete.\nGMs are encouraged to record leveled variants separately for reuse.\n"},"Chapter-8---Monsters/8.3-Playing-a-Sentient-Monster":{"slug":"Chapter-8---Monsters/8.3-Playing-a-Sentient-Monster","filePath":"Chapter 8 - Monsters/8.3 Playing a Sentient Monster.md","title":"8.3 Playing a Sentient Monster","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Sometimes the coolest “race” for your character is… not a race at all, but a monster. That’s allowed in Eyum, with guardrails. Treat this as a collaborative option: you (the player) and your GM co-design a Monster Race Package that plays nicely with the world, the party, and the rules.\nTL;DR: Start small (low CR), build it with your GM, and expect a little homebrew to make the stat block work at the table.\nTable Rules &amp; Baselines\n\nGM Approval Required. You must build your monster with the GM. The GM may say no to specific monsters or features that won’t fit the campaign’s tone, balance, or logistics.\nStart Low-CR. At level 1, you may choose low-CR monsters only (GM’s discretion). Remember that the monsters CR is like their level, so if you will be starting at level 1 in the campaign you should be playing a CR 0 or 1 monster. \nSentience &amp; Speech. If your Intelligence score is below 4, your character cannot speak any language (you can still growl, chirp, gesture, etc.). You also cannot learn or use spoken languages until your Intelligence reaches 4+. If the monster has telepathy or species-specific communication, the GM decides how (or if) that helps. However, sense your monster is more sentient than the average variety you may raise your intelligence if the GM see’s fit. \nYou’ll Homebrew It. Monster stat blocks aren’t plug-and-play as PC races. Expect to adapt, trim, and translate features into player-facing mechanics. That’s normal.\n\nHow to Build a Monster Race Package (with your GM)\nWork through this checklist together. When in doubt, pick the simpler version.\nA) Anatomy &amp; Basics\n\nSize: Use the monster’s size. Remember size rules (reach, squeezing, grappling, equipment fit).\nSpeed: Keep the listed land speed.\nOther movement modes (climb, swim, burrow) are allowed if the monster has them.\nLanguages: If the stat block lists none, you start with no languages. You may learn languages normally if INT ≥ 4. Otherwise, you’re limited to sounds/gestures/instinctual signals.\nB) Ability Score Adjustments\nAs a race package, pick at most +4 total across up to two stats and −2 total across one or two stats to reflect monster physiology (GM may tweak).\nExample: Wolf (+2 DEX, +2 WIS, −2 INT).\nThis replaces the typical point buy system.\nAffinity functions normally but consider all affinities as neutral unless otherwise listed in the monster’s statblock. \nC) Senses\nKeep special senses (darkvision, blindsight, tremorsense) as written for range, unless the GM reduces ranges to fit table expectations.\nD) Natural Armor &amp; AC\nIf the monster has natural armor, set AC = 12 + DexMod (light hide) or 14 + DexMod (max +2) (heavy hide), whichever fits the stat block’s intent. Heavy hide may interfere with some gear (GM call).\nE) Natural Weapons\nConvert attacks into simple natural weapons you’re proficient with:\n\nLight bite/claw/tail: 1d4\nMedium bite/claw/tail: 1d6\nHeavy slam/gore/large bite: 1d8\n\n\nDamage type matches the monster (slashing/piercing/bludgeoning).\nThey count as weapons for rules that care (feats, spells, maneuvers), and can be used with Attack actions.\nF) Multiattack → Player Turn Economy\nEyum uses AP/BAP/RP. Translate Multiattack as:\nOnce per turn, if you take the Attack action with a natural weapon, you may spend 1 BAP to make one additional natural weapon attack (no more than +1 this way at level 1).\nAt character level 5, this improves (GM options): either reduce the BAP cost to 0 once/turn or allow a second BAP attack (still capped at +1 extra unless the GM approves more).\nG) Resistances, Immunities, &amp; Vulnerabilities\nKeep one standout durability feature at level 1 (resistance to X, or immunity to a narrow environmental effect, etc.).\nAdditional resistances/immunities become locked traits you can earn later as you level up, the specific levels which grant which resistences/immunities is up to the GMs discretion. \nH) Equipment &amp; Body Plan\nNonhumanoid bodies complicate gear. Decide what slots you have (head, neck, chest, back, “bracers,” rings, etc.).\nCustom harnesses/armor cost 2× and require a craft check or specialist. Some items may be unusable. That’s part of the fantasy, price it in, don’t ignore it.\nI) Drawbacks\nYou will always gain all drawbacks unless they would provide a massive hindrance in which the GM may rule that you don’t have them. \n\nSocial &amp; Story Expectations\n\nSession Zero: Talk about how a visible monster moves through towns, temples, and guard posts. Will you hide? Wear a cloak? Be infamous? This matters.\nSpotlight Sharing: Your form will create scenes (good and bad). Make sure that attention adds to the party’s fun, not steals it.\nConsequences: Guards may panic. Druids might try to tame you. Villains could mistake you for an ally. Lean into it, Eyum rewards bold choices.\n"},"Chapter-8---Monsters/Monsters/CR-0/Goat":{"slug":"Chapter-8---Monsters/Monsters/CR-0/Goat","filePath":"Chapter 8 - Monsters/Monsters/CR 0/Goat.md","title":"Goat","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nType: Beast\nCR: 0\nAC: 12\nHP: 6 (2d4+1)\nVitality: 4 (1d4+2)\nSpeed: 40 ft\nSize: Small (2–3 ft tall, 60–100 lbs)\nAppearance: Goats are agile, sure-footed animals with curved horns, rough coats, and rectangular pupils.

They squabble constantly, shrieking at one another in high-pitched squeals. Though not aggressive, they may dive-bomb intruders to scare them off or nip at food being carried.

Each wing is nearly transparent, yet dusted with luminous spores that drift in its wake as it glides silently through the night air. Its slender body pulses faintly with arcane energy, and its antennae seem to twitch toward sources of emotion rather than sound. When still, it appears almost painted from mist and silverleaf, disappearing entirely against the sky when it wishes to vanish.\nDisposition: Noctilures are not aggressive but deeply unsettling, drawn to strong emotional currents and sources of magical residue. They congregate in forgotten glades, fae-warped ruins, or quiet battlefield sites where sorrow still lingers.

Bones jut from its back and chest at odd angles, slick with grime, while its face is a half-dissolved skull masked by wet clay. It gurgles as it moves, leaving behind puddles that bubble with trapped air and rot. Its arms stretch unnaturally when striking, dripping globs of sludge that hiss when they touch dry ground.\nDisposition: Sloughgrims are the drowned dead, raised by twisted magic where elemental forces and cursed decay meet swamps, blighted rivers, and sunken crypts. They are slow and mindless, but drawn to motion and warmth, often rising from mire with little warning to drag intruders under. Their instincts are purely destructive: smother, trap, and choke. While easily outpaced on open land, in wet terrain they become deadly, able to slow and drown prey in moments.

Its eyes glow with emberlight, two seething coals set deep into a lean, lupine skull. When it exhales, wisps of black smoke rise from its nostrils and the gaps between its bared, fire-licked teeth. A faint smell of burnt wood lingers in its wake, and its pawprints occasionally scorch the ground, especially in dry brush or forest undergrowth.\nDisposition: Sootfangs are relentless hunters bred from flame and shadow. While not particularly cunning, they are fiercely territorial and will chase down intruders with unyielding speed and primal aggression. They favor ambushes cloaked in smoke, using their innate ability to obscure vision before striking. These creatures are most often found patrolling volcanic ridges, scorched forests, or ancient battlegrounds still smoldering with magical ruin.

The air around it vibrates with a metallic hum, like a struck wire, and its presence alone makes skin crawl and blood feel unsteady in the veins.\nDisposition: The Death Slaad is violence distilled into strategy. It prunes battlefields with cruel calculation—eliminating healers first, cutting down mages second, and leaving the rest to collapse in despair. It strikes with sudden, joyful savagery, then goes perfectly still, listening, waiting, before rushing to silence the loudest dying cry.

Dove-like wings fold across their back, carrying with them the quiet dignity of a chapel at dawn. Wherever they tread, dust settles in reverence, and the air fills with the remembered scent of rain on stone.\nDisposition: Devas arrive as emissaries first, avengers second. They extend surrender or parley before lifting their blade, preferring to interpose themselves for the weak and disable foes rather than slay them outright. Yet when oaths are broken or cruelty is unveiled, their precision turns lethal, striking as divine judgment.

Dust blooms with each ponderous step, and when its head turns, the sound of grinding quarry stones echoes ominously. A faint, pulsing glow radiates from the rune engraved in its chest, throbbing like a heartbeat too slow to be mortal.\nDisposition: A relentless sentinel, the Stone Golem is utterly devoted to its warded purpose. Pain, provocation, or distraction mean nothing to it—only the command etched into its being.

Its arms are colossal pylons shaped like ancient war-hammers, every swing tearing the air with thunderous arcs. A thundercloud perpetually follows it, lightning striking its frame to recharge the volatile storm-core that burns in its chest.

Their very presence is lofty, as though the air thins around them, setting mortals gasping beneath the weight of altitude.\nDisposition: Lords of high castles and endless skies, Cloud Giants fight with elegance and precision. They rarely waste blows, preferring to hurl boulders that shepherd enemies into killing grounds they prepare with their control of wind and fog. In battle, they keep their height advantage, stepping sideways onto balconies of conjured cloudstuff to command the battlefield with vantage. Cruelty does not drive them, but supremacy does—when the fight grows crude, they disengage skyward, waiting until they can descend on terms of their choosing.\n\nAttributes\n\nSTR: 64 (+27)\nDEX: 40 (+15)\nCON: 58 (+24)\nINT: 28 (+9)\nWIS: 42 (+16)\nCHA: 54 (+22)\n\nResistances: Lightning, Physical (non-magical)\nWeaknesses: Thunder\nAbilities\n\nMorningstar.

Its grinding voice echoes like millstones turning in deep caverns, and the air around it carries the scent of hot dust, scorched earth, and cardamom. When it descends into battle, the ground itself bends to its will, reshaping terrain into traps, walls, and shifting dunes.\nDisposition: Pragmatic and calculating, the Dao is not a mindless brute but a contractor of earth’s might. It prefers to entomb foes alive, collapsing caverns or sealing doors behind waves of stone rather than spilling unnecessary blood. Patient and cruel, it wears enemies down step by step, forcing them uphill into exhaustion while the battlefield itself becomes a cage.

When it speaks, its voice echoes as though carried from domes and tiled halls, commanding reverence and dread alike. The air bends around it, pressure shifting as if the wind itself bows to its presence.\nDisposition: Proud, mercurial, and bound by ancient codes of hospitality, the Djinni may enter as a courteous host, offering riddles or tasks to test worth. Yet insult or defiance turns its grace into wrath, and the storm answers. In battle, it fights as both duelist and tempest, soaring above foes while conjuring cyclones to scatter formations.

Every step leaves glassed sand behind, every breath carries the scent of cinnamon, smoke, and molten iron. Its eyes blaze with cruel intelligence, and its laughter is a furnace roar.\nDisposition: Efreeti are merchant-kings and tyrant warlords, creatures who honor deals only to twist them later into shackles. They dominate not only by power but by manipulation, binding mortals into servitude with contracts etched in fire.

Her eyes are twin stars, luminous and unyielding, piercing even the deepest dark. Every step carries an aura of inevitability, and her voice thrums with timeless weight, like prophecy wrapped in riddle.\nDisposition: Keeper of divine riddles and forbidden lore, the Gynosphinx is a gate and a test. She offers choice before conflict: solve her challenge or face her wrath. She wields her power with precision, binding intruders with words of geas and scattering armies with a roar that echoes across eternity. She is neither cruel nor merciful—her only loyalty is to the protection of secrets.

Its spear-length horns curve forward with cruel precision, and its barbed tail never ceases to flick, shedding sparks that hang in the air like dying stars. Each beat of its ribbed wings scatters cinders across the battlefield, announcing its presence as a herald of infernal order. Its face is grim and calculating, lips never moving except to pronounce judgment already written.\nDisposition: Horned Devils are hell’s iron fist, sent to enforce the terms of infernal contracts or to punish breaches with ruthless precision.

Dented plates bear scars of sieges long past, yet no rust dares touch its surface. Glowing arcane circuits crawl across its bulk like veins of molten iron, pulsing with each earth-shaking stride. Its piledriver fists are built to break fortresses as easily as bone, and when it halts, the air quivers under its weight.\nDisposition: The Ironscourge is a remorseless siege-engine, following its final command with unwavering precision: annihilate resistance. It wades through armies as if they were tall grass, shrugging off steel and arrow alike, advancing without pause. It knows no mercy, no surrender, and no fear. In battle, it adapts, shifting its weight to counter evasive foes, or locking down into siege stance to endure magical bombardment.

Shells and pearls adorn its watery frame, ringing like temple chimes. The ground under its presence grows damp, while the air tastes faintly of brine and thunder.\nDisposition: The Marid is a courtly storm given flesh. Proud but not cruel, it insists on courtesy in word and deed—yet when crossed, it unleashes oceanic wrath.

They do not hunt for hunger alone, but for dominion—snatching livestock, heroes, or even entire caravans to scatter across the peaks.

Hovering quills drip ink into sigils orbiting its wrists, while seals and strings weave around it like a scribe’s halo. Its eyes burn lantern-amber, tallying every movement as though recording debts in real time. When it smiles, the scent of vellum and wax fills the air, and its footprints spell words in forgotten tongues before vanishing like erased script.\nDisposition: Arcanaloths are duelists of law and probability, weaving battlefields into ledgers of inevitability. They open with courtesy, buying missteps in conversation before punishing every breach of order.

Its sword is no simple weapon but a shard of hell itself, wreathed in black flame that screams when it strikes.\nDisposition: Arch Demons are apex shock troops of the lower hells, destruction incarnate given form.

It never meets strength with strength; it teaches need. First it stains lungs with thought—whispers cast as currents—then it asks the one who listens best to bring the others.

Old bite-marks scar the enamel; iron staples hold jawbones where decay broke them. A cone of pale darkness pours from the central socket like moonlight run backward, bleaching color and hope.\nDisposition: Mortuary general. It treats combat as a procession—slow, ceremonial, inexorable.

It shapes the field with walls of ice, pins prey with spearwork precise as drill, and punishes warmth—torches, campfires, courage alike.

Its surface appears translucent in places, revealing glimpses of celestial void and distant constellations pulsing beneath its skin. Eyes dot its form irregularly, each blinking at different rhythms as if perceiving multiple dimensions at once. When it moves, the air bends unnaturally, as though struggling to remember where the creature actually is.\nDisposition: Nytherions are thought to be born from rifts in the fabric of reality, ancient echoes of astral storms or failed gods that never fully died. They are immensely intelligent but alien in purpose, drawn to sites of magical upheaval or cosmic imbalance. Though rarely aggressive without cause, their presence destabilizes the world around them, warping matter and thought alike. In battle, they blink across space with precision, unleashing waves of destructive force that tear not at flesh, but at the very idea of being.

Frost hisses to steam where it passes; snow caves into slush beneath its many clawed legs. Scarred segments show where blades melted into the chitin and remain as black glass islands. Two petaled jaws fold back to reveal a throat like a smelting channel; heat mirage coils from its breath even in subzero air. Its tunnel walls are glazed to greenish glass, seeded with the shadows of things that tried to flee.\nDisposition: Winter ambush artist and thermal trap. The remorhaz stalks by listening—vibrations on ice, the drum of boots—then erupts under the rearmost, swallowing and retreating before lines can reform.

Fresh-dug earth clings to joints; its mandibles drip grit and mica dust that tastes bitter on the tongue.\nDisposition: Disorientation engine. It breaks line of sight with a wall of earth, bursts out at a right angle with a roar that rattles teeth, then deletes one target before the party’s bearings return.

Its hide is midnight velvet that drinks torchlight; its tusks are scrimshawed with names that start whispering when read.\nDisposition: Temptation tactician. It offers victory now at a price later, and while heroes debate, it makes the debate worse—dragging one ally into reach with a handshake while the pincers select a limb to remember.

Gold cartouches and cracked faience beads stitch their history across the chest in glyph lines; dried oils perfume the air with myrrh and dust.

When it surfaces, wind pulls toward it, as if the world were inhaling.\nDisposition: Catastrophe more than combatant. It answers sound with geometry: swallow the drummer, collapse the mezzanine, make the room fit the worm.

Silks carry patterns that repeat at impossible intervals; jewels show reflections from other rooms. Incense follows it like applause. Writing near it tends to rearrange so the most flattering lines rise to the top.\nDisposition: Duelist of promises. It feasts on certainty, first by predicting it, then by selling it back on worse terms. It opens with flattery that sounds like command, uses illusions to braid allies into each other’s lines of fire, and strikes only where betrayal will echo.

Its horns sweep forward like paired scimitars, and the membranes of its wings are crosshatched from sandstorms. When it speaks, dust lifts from the ground in little whirlwinds.\nDisposition: Patient, territorial hunter of open skies. It circles at extreme altitude until the party exposes a weakness, then lashes down in a crackling dive to obliterate a single target with lightning before tunneling into dunes to reset the fight.

Its helm reveals no face, only a deep void from which flickers of green flame and whispers of the damned emerge. Its greatsword is a towering slab of cursed steel, glowing faintly with necrotic energy and leaving trails of ash with every swing. Each step it takes leaves a scar upon the earth, and the weight of its presence alone seems to bend the air with dread.\nDisposition: Once a titan-blessed warlord who fell in a pact-bound betrayal, the Dreadforged rises from its tomb with vengeance and hatred forged into its very bones. It exists only to conquer, marching without rest or remorse, cleaving through battalions with each sweep of its blade. Even death does not end its fury, when its body fails, its soul claws its way back into form, rising again in a blaze of undeath.

Incense and blood cling to her like perfume.\nDisposition: She choreographs combat. The marilith locks the front line with a tangle of blades, tail-wraps anyone who slips past, and counterpivots to place allies into flanking triangles.

Its face is a mask of shifting geometry, with countless eyes blinking across its surface in patterns that defy logic. When it speaks, it does so with a dozen voices at once, some distant, some whispering, and some echoing from within your own mind. Veins of violet energy pulse through its robes like living circuitry, feeding on thought and fear.\nDisposition: Mindreavers are agents of madness sent forth from deep rifts in reality, harbingers of unraveling sentience. Highly intelligent and terrifyingly composed, they do not act on impulse, they orchestrate. Each encounter is a psychological war, with the Mindreaver unraveling its foes’ confidence, memory, and will before striking with devastating psychic force.

Armor appears as layered light; its sword hums with hymns only the guilty hear. Wherever it treads, dust settles, wounds close a little easier, and torches burn without smoke.\nDisposition: Mercy held in mailed fist. A planetar calls for surrender once; if refused, it cuts diagonally through the line to behead the sin it has judged, then spends the rest of its turn saving who can be saved—dragging the penitent out of fire, interposing wing and blade against the next blow.

Its mane crackles with desert heat; sand swirls into script where its paws fall.\nDisposition: Examiner and executioner. It offers riddles as gates—mercy to the wise, ruin to the unworthy.

Its eyes burn like dying stars, and each movement sends cracks through the ground, accompanied by the echo of distant thunder. Moss, magma, and crystal cling to its surface like a living mantle, and its voice, if ever heard, is a tremor through the bones rather than the air. When it lifts its massive fists, even mountains seem to brace.\nDisposition: The Colossus is not a guardian, nor a destroyer, it is a consequence. Awakened only when balance is shattered or elemental forces surge out of control, it moves with slow, deliberate purpose, as if aware that each step reshapes the world. While not malicious, it is utterly unrelenting in its path, often unaware of the destruction it causes in pursuit of its unknowable objective. Against those who resist, it brings the wrath of tectonic fury and storm-forged resilience, shrugging off mortal efforts like a landslide shrugs off stone.

It challenges the strongest, forcing champions to commit while its aura rots courage from the rest. It punishes spellcasting with sudden pressure and never lets a healer work in peace.

Iron rings pierce its forearms and shoulders where chains once tried—and failed—to hold it.

Across its chest, scarified sigils of conquest have been clawed over into chaos, as if even the act of being named was an insult it could not tolerate.\nDisposition: Brute shock-trooper that thinks in straight lines and collapsing walls. A goristro makes a charge lane with shoulders and horns, plowing through cover so the battlefield becomes narrow, brutal, and its own. It targets the heaviest armor first—the better to humiliate a “champion”—then uses reach to keep rescuers off. If kited, it smashes pillars to drop ceilings, turning pursuit into a cave-in race.

Plates of blackened crimson overlap like roof tiles fired in a kiln; heat shimmers off its belly scales even in snow. Horns curl back in scorched ivory ridges, and each exhale carries cinders that skitter across stone before winking out. Its roosts are galleries of ruin—slagged gold, glassed sand, and murals of soot where flame licked the walls.\nDisposition: An apex tyrant that treats the battlefield as a forge. It opens with a strafing pass of fire to break formation, then chooses a champion to humiliate in melee while the rest watch.

Arcs of lightning leap from its shoulders with each movement, and its voice rumbles like distant thunder when it speaks, or roars. Its blade is forged from condensed skyfire, pulsing with barely restrained power, and its eyes are twin vortices of swirling wind and stormlight. The air around it trembles constantly, and its very presence makes it feel like the calm just before catastrophe.\nDisposition: Stormshards serve as eternal sentinels of balance in the elemental skies, avatars of judgment and retribution wielded by ancient forces or tempest-bound pacts. They act with measured wrath, delivering destruction only when provoked or commanded, but their fury is absolute once unleashed. Moving with the precision of lightning and the relentlessness of a stormfront, they strike down enemies before they can retaliate, weaving between attacks with the grace of wind incarnate. Their dominion over weather shields them from distant harm, and even the bravest archers find their arrows lost in the storm that follows them.\n\nAttributes\n\nSTR: 85 (+37)\nDEX: 70 (+30)\nCON: 80 (+35)\nINT: 30 (+10)\nWIS: 60 (+25)\nCHA: 60 (+25)\n\nResistances: Lightning, Thunder, Force, Non-magical Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing\nWeaknesses: Cold\nAbilities\n\nStormblade.

Its flesh is bloated and cracked with greenish-black veins, constantly leaking tendrils of pestilent mist. Glowing glyphs of undeath pulse along its skin like infected runes, and its elongated claws drip with a putrid substance that sizzles against any living matter. When it speaks, its voice is the sound of corpses gasping beneath the soil, rasping, layered, and wrong.\nDisposition: Carrionshades are avatars of death without decay, undying tyrants cursed to rule plague-choked lands from cryptic thrones. Intelligent and cruel, they do not seek conquest through might alone, but through the slow erosion of hope, life, and resistance. Their presence rots the ground, fouls the air, and invites blight to anything that lingers too long in their shadow. Even when brought to the brink of death, they rise again, borne on unholy willpower and the whispers of those they’ve buried.

Gemstones sit where teeth and eyes belonged; they drink light rather than reflect it. Lines of runes are etched into the sutures like maps of vanished empires. When it turns, air temperature drops a degree and parchment nearby curls inward. Every corridor it has haunted remembers: candles gutter toward it, tapestries fade, and the color red seems to hesitate before crossing the threshold.\nDisposition: Tyrant of the invisible layers—sound, memory, breath. A demilich is patient to cruelty: it waits until the party’s cadence is steady, then removes a beat—silence here, a sleep there—so that teamwork unravels one thread at a time. It rarely moves; it repositions the fight instead, by collapsing stairs, stealing voices, or swallowing the room’s air in a single hungry breath.

The “face” is a rose window of smoked crystal; silhouettes pace within—echoes of congregations long ground into ash. Bell-chains hang inside the chest cavity and toll in muffled heartbeats when the construct turns. Where it steps, stone vitrifies to mirrors; where it strikes, mosaics shatter into razors that rearrange themselves into new prayers.\nDisposition: Territory as doctrine. The Basilica redraws the arena into naves and transepts: it drops panes to create aisles, pins the rash behind glass, and forces everyone else to fight in its pews. It advances like ritual—step, toll, cut—denying angles until only the center aisle remains, and that’s where its hammer falls. If surrounded, it folds glass into itself and emerges two “chapters” away with the party now standing in a confessional.\n\nAttributes\n\nSTR: 120 (+50)\nDEX: 40 (+15)\nCON: 130 (+55)\nINT: 30 (+10)\nWIS: 60 (+25)\nCHA: 40 (+15)\n\nResistances: Physical (non-magical), Fire, Cold, Poison\nWeaknesses: Thunder\nAbilities\n\nCathedral Hammer.

Where feathers molt, darkness flakes away in glints like stilled snow; where it looks, dust aligns as if obeying a quiet hymn. Silver script crawls across its skin, redacting itself as vows change. When the Seraph draws its blade, the edge shows places where light failed—and was forgiven.\nDisposition: Shepherd of thresholds. It tries peace first, not to spare foes but to spare witnesses, shaping battles to doorways and bridges where retreat remains possible. When forced to kill, it fights like an editor: removing lies (illusions), cutting noise (buffs), and paring the scene down to a single, clean stroke. If allies falter, it interposes with geometry, moving in straight lines that somehow bend space to be between blade and victim every time.\n\nAttributes\n\nSTR: 115 (+47)\nDEX: 80 (+30)\nCON: 120 (+50)\nINT: 70 (+25)\nWIS: 100 (+40)\nCHA: 100 (+40)\n\nResistances: Radiant (Immunity), Psychic, Fire, Cold\nWeaknesses: Necrotic\nAbilities\n\nEclipse Blade.

Six gill-arches glow with pale aurora; between them, gravity beads the sea into trembling pearls that fall upward. Barnacles on its flanks have grown into spiraled antennae; each rotates to “listen” to intent as much as sound. Wherever it feeds, light arrives late: torches bend toward its shadow, and bubbles orbit its jaws before surrendering.\nDisposition: Patient orbital hunter. It keeps to the edge of perception—just beyond lantern range or just below the thermocline—probing with invisible tugs that pull formation apart. When a straggler shifts out of step, the Leviathan adjusts the battlefield instead of its path: floors tilt, currents reverse, and cover becomes a river carrying you toward its mouth. It prefers to win by inevitability: choose the weakest focus, magnify their panic with the ocean itself, and let fear write the rest. If seriously hurt, it folds space the width of a heartbeat and reappears behind the loudest mind in the room.\n\nAttributes\n\nSTR: 120 (+50)\nDEX: 40 (+15)\nCON: 110 (+45)\nINT: 70 (+25)\nWIS: 90 (+35)\nCHA: 80 (+30)\n\nResistances: Psychic\nWeaknesses: Radiant\nAbilities\n\nAbyssal Maw.

Ember-veins ladder the armor; each pulse corresponds to a soul screaming through the chimneys in its back. A blade like a collapsed anvil rides across its lap, chained to the throne by prayer-links made of rusted crowns. The ground remembers its passages as clinker glass and heel-shaped craters.\nDisposition: Dictatorship made kinetic. The Imperator doesn’t chase; it annexes—plants its throne in the center, declares every step a tax, and fines anyone who tries to maneuver with furnace gales.

Its eyes are polished onyx lenses that show not your reflection but your intent. Feathers at the wingtips carry ink that never dries; wherever it perches, stone acquires marginalia. Questions asked in its presence leave frost on the tongue.\nDisposition: Court of causality. The Sphinx never attacks first; it demands a proposition. When the claim is weak, it edits the claimant—slowing steps with paradox, binding hands with the consequences of their own boast. It arranges fights as proofs: isolate the lemma (your healer), dismantle the axiom (your formation), then present the theorem (your defeat) with terrifying, patient grace.

Its weapon is a colossal flame-forged cleaver, glowing with internal fire and trailing embers with every swing. Its presence is accompanied by a chorus of whispers and screams, as if the souls of the damned follow in its wake.\nDisposition: The Infernal Dreadlord is not merely a commander of hellish forces, it is a walking apocalypse, born to lead infernal conquests across planes. It rules through terror and overwhelming force, driving lesser fiends before it and crushing resistance with volcanic wrath. Every strike it delivers shatters the will of armies, and its voice alone can send seasoned heroes fleeing in despair.

It possesses no solid shape, only a vaguely humanoid silhouette with arms that stretch unnaturally, crowned by a veil of shifting tendrils and two piercing violet eyes that burn through the dark. It floats silently, casting no light and bearing no weight, yet the air grows heavy and thick with dread wherever it passes. Even its presence dims magic and memory, as if the world itself recoils from knowing it.\nDisposition: Umbracrypts are sovereigns of unreality, masters of thought-warping despair and spatial collapse. They emerge only in moments of total shadow, when a plane is weak, a seal breaks, or a mind falls too far into madness. Their tactics are precise, devastating, and patient; they manipulate space and perception before ever drawing blood.

If scorched, the Behemoth sinks into soil, spreads its heart through a thousand rootlets, and rises behind you, taller.\n\nAttributes\n\nSTR: 140 (+60)\nDEX: 70 (+30)\nCON: 130 (+55)\nINT: 40 (+15)\nWIS: 100 (+45)\nCHA: 60 (+25)\n\nResistances: Poison; Physical (non-magical); Psychic\nWeaknesses: Fire\nAbilities\n\nRoot-Mass Slam.

Their bodies gleam like polished stone, but beneath the sheen lies a frantic, seething hunger. The swarm flows over surfaces like a living oil spill, climbing walls, pouring through cracks, and hurling itself at prey with uncanny coordination. When in motion, the air fills with a deafening chorus of clicks, chittering, and the dry rasp of clawed limbs skittering over stone and wood.\nDisposition: Though mindless in the traditional sense, the Chitterfang Swarm behaves with disturbing cohesion, driven by a single collective instinct: devour. They react to movement and heat with terrifying speed, overwhelming their target in a tide of slicing mandibles and suffocating weight. Though weak individually, their numbers make them a serious threat in confined spaces or cluttered terrain. Most commonly found in crypts, abandoned mines, and corrupted rootways, these swarms are drawn to rot, blood, and magic left to decay.

When in flight, its body leaves behind a faint trail of drifting ash, and its claws burn faintly orange even in total darkness. Its eyes are pinpricks of fire, and its fur appears charred, constantly shedding flecks of soot. Despite its volatile form, the Cinderwisp is eerily graceful, gliding on thermals with whisper-quiet wings that flare brilliantly when it attacks.\nDisposition: Cinderwisps are born from firestorms, volcanic vents, or failed summoning rituals, and they act as swift, skittish predators of the high skies and scorched lands. While not overtly aggressive, they are territorial and prone to dive-bombing threats with streaks of flame before vanishing into the smoke. Their favorite tactic is to lure foes into dry terrain, then ignite the ground in a fiery cyclone upon landing.

Its tusks are nearly a foot long and stained from past battles.

Its joints creak with oxidized grinding, and its mouth is lined with mismatched, serrated fangs forged from twisted rebar and broken blades. Rust constantly flakes from its body as it moves, leaving reddish smears wherever it treads. Two dull, red-lit eyes glow beneath a brow of cracked plating, and its breath smells of molten iron and decay.\nDisposition: Ferrivexes exist only to feed, on steel, iron, brass, or anything resembling metal. They are relentless in their pursuit of machinery, weapons, or armor, often breaking into vaults or siege camps by gnawing through barriers that would stop most beasts. Though not truly intelligent, they exhibit rudimentary tracking behavior and can “smell” metal through walls. Their corrosive bite is feared by adventurers, as even a glancing wound can dissolve gear in moments. Left in forgotten forges or scrapyards, Ferrivexes grow stronger the longer they feast, swelling with warped reinforcements as they consume the ruins around them.\n\nAttributes\n\nSTR: 12 (+1)\nDEX: 10 (+0)\nCON: 12 (+1)\nINT: 3 (−4)\nWIS: 4 (−3)\nCHA: 3 (−4)\n\nResistances: Poison, Psychic\nWeaknesses: Thunder\nAbilities\n\nIron Bite.

The Prime doesn’t chase—it reroutes. Walls appear where allies stood, floors tilt into pits, and hallways fold sideways to trap the bold. It seeks control over slaughter, capturing foes to force them deeper into its solved puzzle.\n\nAttributes\n\nSTR: 150 (+65)\nDEX: 100 (+40)\nCON: 160 (+70)\nINT: 110 (+45)\nWIS: 120 (+50)\nCHA: 90 (+35)\n\nResistances: Psychic; Physical (non-magical); Force\nWeaknesses: Thunder\nAbilities\n\nArchitect’s Hammer. Melee Weapon Attack: +60 to hit, reach 20 ft, one target. Hit: 55d12+65 bludgeoning. On hit, a 10-ft-thick wall panel rises adjacent to the target (AC 95, 2,000 HP, immune to psychic and poison). The wall grants the Prime three-quarters cover until destroyed.\nMaze Pulse (Recharge 5–6). 120-ft cone. Each creature must succeed on a DC 98 INT save or be Banished into a sub-maze. While banished, the creature has speed 0, can act on its own turn, but cannot affect or perceive the battlefield. At the end of each of its turns, it may attempt a DC 98 INT check. On success, it escapes to the nearest open space.\nRedirect Path (Reaction). When a creature within 60 ft attempts to move, the Prime forces a DC 96 WIS save. On failure, the creature’s movement is rotated up to 180° to a direction of the Prime’s choice (cannot move into hazardous terrain unless already moving there).\nLiving Maze (Passive). The area within 300 ft of the Prime constantly reshapes. All terrain counts as difficult terrain for enemies. When a creature uses movement, roll 1d6: on a 5–6, a wall rises to block line of sight until destroyed (AC 90, 1,500 HP).\nImprisoning Fold (Recharge 6). The Prime folds the battlefield into itself. All enemies within 200 ft must succeed on a DC 98 STR save or be crushed into a prison-hallway. While trapped, they are Restrained, take 20d12 bludgeoning at the start of their turn, and can only escape by destroying the fold (AC 95, 3,000 HP).\n"},"Chapter-8---Monsters/Monsters/CR-20/Pit-Fiend":{"slug":"Chapter-8---Monsters/Monsters/CR-20/Pit-Fiend","filePath":"Chapter 8 - Monsters/Monsters/CR 20/Pit Fiend.md","title":"Pit Fiend","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nType: Fiend\nCR: 20\nAC: 500\nHP: 70,000 (1,400d12+35,000)\nVitality: 52,000 (1,040d10+26,000)\nSpeed: 50 ft, Fly 100 ft\nSize: Large (12–14 ft, 2,500–4,000 lbs)\nAppearance: A red, iron-scaled tyrant with wings like fortress gates.

Its feathers drip molten embers with every beat, leaving trails of fire that linger in the air like burning banners. Its eyes blaze like twin eclipses, and its voice is a searing shriek that cracks the sky. Even gazing upon it for too long scorches the mind, and when it descends, the very earth smolders beneath its shadow.\nDisposition: Asharion is not a creature, it is a reckoning. Manifesting only during omens of great devastation or in response to catastrophic imbalance, it does not negotiate or spare. It incinerates armies with sweeping firestorms and rises from death with renewed fury, each resurrection more radiant than the last.

Its titanic form looms between dimensions, comprised of endless, coiling tentacles that twist through unreality and shimmer with hues that fray the minds of those who perceive them. Its surface ripples like liquid thought, constantly reforming itself with impossible angles and shifting geometries. The world bends around it, as if resisting the truth of its presence. No two creatures see the same thing when they look upon Azathis, only the overwhelming certainty that it should not exist.\nDisposition: Azathis does not act, it dreams. And what it dreams becomes real. It is the end of sanity given motion, the final question that no mind can survive asking. Its very presence unravels logic, causality, and identity. Empires crumble in its wake not by war, but by forgetting they ever were. In battle, Azathis does not merely damage, it unmakes perception. Reality bends to its will, reshaped by thought alone.

Around it, time bends, gravity inverts, and even thoughts begin to fray. Its voice is silence devouring sound, and its eye, if it has one, is the absence of all things, reflecting not what is, but what will never be again.\nDisposition: The Black Maw of Oblivion is not a destroyer. It is what remains when even destruction has ended. It does not rage, nor reason, nor hunger in a mortal sense, it absorbs. Worlds, gods, memories, and souls are drawn into it, never to return, as it expands its domain of nothingness across existence. Each creature it consumes is not merely slain, it is erased, and its essence twisted into the Maw’s ever-growing anomaly.

A vast, impossible maw dominates its front, layered with interlocking teeth that shimmer with gravitational distortion. Countless eyes, some massive, others microscopic, dot its length, blinking asynchronously with malicious intelligence. Wherever it moves, the stars seem to dim, and the air groans as if creation itself fears being undone.\nDisposition: Ezereth is annihilation made aware, a being that drifts between planes to consume entire realms, driven not by hunger but by inevitability. It does not rage or plot, it erases. It unthreads destiny, devours souls, and reduces continents to silence. Those who gaze into its eyes see not death, but the absence of meaning. In combat, it warps gravity, shatters reality, and absorbs the vitality of anything it touches, growing stronger with each act of destruction.

It radiates an aura of cosmic dread, warping the air with divine gravity and making even the bravest hearts falter in its shadow.\nDisposition: Orrakar is the final decree of failing stars, a herald of balance so absolute that life, death, and law are meaningless in its presence. It does not hate, nor does it favor, it ends. Orrakar arrives only when the universe demands correction, when celestial laws are sundered by mortal ambition or divine hubris.

Light bends around it, thought stutters near it, and to look upon it directly is to feel yourself observed in ways no mind should endure.\nDisposition: Orreryn is not a ruler by choice, it is dominion. The concept of sovereignty crystallized into will. It was not born but coalesced from the need for order where none could exist. Orreryn does not destroy, it subjugates. Entire pantheons have bent before its gaze, entire worlds realigned to serve its psychic network of control. In combat, it is omniscient, unyielding, and absolute. Its gaze twists reality, its mind overwhelms even demigods, and only those bearing the tools of creation’s first fire may end its reign. To defy Orreryn is to defy the notion that anything exists apart from its will.\nSTR: 50 (+20) | DEX: 20 (+5) | CON: 48 (+19) | INT: 40 (+15) | WIS: 38 (+14) | CHA: 50 (+20)\nResistances: Immune to all Non-Magical Damage, Psychic, Force, Necrotic, Radiant\nWeaknesses: None\nLegendary Actions (5/Turn):\nUltimate Strike: Melee Attack +30 to hit, 20d12+20 Force Damage.\nReality Warp (Recharge 6): Reshapes the battlefield, imposing disadvantage on all enemy attacks and saving throws.\nAbsolute Domination: Can instantly control any creature of CR 20 or lower.\nImmortality: If reduced to 0 HP, regenerates at full HP after 3 turns unless slain with a god-tier artifact."},"Chapter-8---Monsters/Monsters/CR-21+-(WIP)/Primordial-Godbeast-(CR---27)":{"slug":"Chapter-8---Monsters/Monsters/CR-21+-(WIP)/Primordial-Godbeast-(CR---27)","filePath":"Chapter 8 - Monsters/Monsters/CR 21+ (WIP)/Primordial Godbeast (CR - 27).md","title":"Primordial Godbeast (CR - 27)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Type: Beast\nCR: 27\nAC: 30\nHP: 1,500 (90d12+800)\nVitality: 1,000 (90d10+800)\nSpeed: 70 ft, Fly 120 ft\nSize: Gargantuan\nHeight/Length: 100 ft long\nWeight: 100,000 lbs\nAppearance: The Primordial Godbeast is a colossal force of celestial majesty, its 100-foot frame cloaked in radiant white-gold fur or scales that shimmer with divine brilliance.

Wings made of woven starlight stretch across the heavens, trailing light and cosmic harmony in their wake. Its very form warps gravity, parting clouds and silencing all sound within miles when it moves.\nDisposition: The Primordial Godbeast is the silent will of creation incarnate, neither good nor evil, but balance given breath. It slumbers beyond the stars, stirring only when the fabric of reality faces annihilation or when divinity itself falters. In battle, it is nothing short of cataclysmic: a being of raw judgment that crushes even gods beneath its charge and heals faster than the cosmos can keep up.

The solar enters like a sunrise—warning first, then blinding action.

Standing over 80 feet tall, its form radiates blistering heat and gravity-warping pressure, its limbs crowned with jagged peaks and seething with magma. Each step quakes the land for miles, and its eyes blaze with primeval fire, silent, eternal, and absolute. Even approaching Thauron feels like trespassing into the final heartbeat of the world.\nDisposition: Thauron is not a creature that fights, it ends. Awakened only in the final hours of balance-breaking cataclysm, Thauron does not rage or reason; it marches, its presence alone toppling mountains and sundering continents. Its blows are planetary events, and it shrugs off attacks like a god ignoring insects. Though mindless in the mortal sense, its path is unwavering and terrifyingly purposeful.

Around it, space bends like liquid, stars twist into impossible shapes, and the laws of physics stutter in panic. Matter is torn into streamers of atoms as they spiral into its gravity well, and reality frays into unreadable fragments just by proximity. No sound escapes it. No light reflects from it. It is hunger made form.\nDisposition: The Devouring Singularity has no mind, no intent, no will, only function. It is a universal failsafe, a godless eraser summoned only when reality must be broken to be reborn. Its presence signifies the unraveling of all resistance, for it cannot be bargained with, wounded, slowed, or destroyed. It does not move, it pulls. Every moment it exists is a countdown to the erasure of all within its reach. It cannot be reasoned with, for it has never acknowledged the existence of anything but itself.

Its silhouette is jagged and unnatural, shoulders like cliffs, fists like siege engines, and a head crowned with a ring of weathered spires. With every step, the ground groans and splits beneath its weight, and the air around it is thick with drifting dust and the scent of scorched earth. Its gaze is slow and hollow, not blind, just far too ancient to care what it sees.\nDisposition: The Titan is ruin given form. It does not seek conquest or glory, it exists to end, to grind civilizations to gravel and leave only silence behind. Once awakened, it marches with glacial inevitability, immune to fear, pain, or reason. Its presence bends reality: walls crumble, courage falters, and entire legions break before ever raising a blade. The Titan does not speak, it does not rest, and it cannot be diverted.

A towering figure cloaked in fathomless darkness, it exists in a constant state of phase, flickering between dimensions with every breath. Its silhouette is fluid, fractal, and immense, swathed in a cloak of swirling black starfire, with countless eyes and mouths appearing and vanishing across its shape in rhythmic chaos. Its presence devours light, hope, and reason. Those who gaze upon it do not scream, they forget why they ever knew how.\nDisposition: The True King of the Void is the absolute end, the god beyond gods, the ruler of the final silence. It does not conquer, because there is nothing it does not already own. Its will supersedes the multiverse, and its thoughts define the very fabric of existence. All beings below it exist by tolerance alone. It does not rage, punish, or desire, it simply decides. In combat, it wields power beyond any form of opposition: issuing commands that override autonomy, obliterating matter, soul, and memory with a gesture, and once per day, removing something from the universe entirely.

Stars flicker within its scales, and each movement reshapes the starlight around it like ripples on an infinite sea. Its wings are not wings at all, but curtains of void stuff trailing behind it like gravitational scars, and its deep-violet eyes hold the silent will of a universe watching itself die. When it flies, it does not soar, it bends space to accommodate its passing.\nDisposition: Xal’Zareth is not death, but the unmaking that follows it. An ancient force birthed from the void between the first stars, it exists to unravel creation, thought, form, soul. It does not communicate, reason, or rage. It simply erases. The strongest of beings are reduced to memory in its presence, and even memory falters in time.

Its jagged horns rise like black spires, and massive wings stretch behind it like cloaks of smoldering void. Smoke pours constantly from its joints and mouth, and its eyes burn with ancient hatred and divine betrayal. The ground buckles beneath its steps, and its voice carries like an echo from the core of the world, felt in the marrow more than heard.\nDisposition: Xar’zul is the sovereign of ruinous pacts and twisted empires, a god of dominion through agony. It offers power to the desperate, only to demand the soul in full when the cost is forgotten. On the battlefield, it does not merely slay, it commands legions, carves rifts into the earth, and blots the sky with infernal ash.

Its body twists with unnatural grace, rippling like smoke when it moves and leaving behind faint trails of darkness that dissipate seconds after contact. When it opens its mouth, its fangs gleam silver, and a low hissing hum fills the air like whispered curses.\nDisposition: Duskscourges are predatory nightmares that haunt the liminal places between light and dark, cave mouths at dusk, temple ruins during eclipse, or forest borders at moonrise. They are clever and patient, often stalking prey unseen for hours before striking from the shadows in a blur of fangs and gloom.

Its “face” is a cracked, bark-covered knot that shifts subtly as it moves, and its limbs creak with the weight of centuries. Roots dangle from its torso like tattered robes, and small sprouts, fungi, and insects often live along its shoulders and back. Despite its bulk, the Gnarlroot can move with uncanny silence, blending into forests as though it were just another part of the land.\nDisposition: Gnarlroots are ancient wardens of the wild, slow to act but devastating when provoked.

Its skin hangs in tatters, green with algae and streaked with dark mud, sloughing off in places to reveal muscle and bone that pulses with unnatural life. Its eyes glow a sickly green, casting an eerie shimmer across the water when it surfaces. The creature emits a constant stench of sulfur, stagnant water, and decay, trailing pieces of marsh flora as it lumbers forth.\nDisposition: Drawn to the warmth of the living, Mirewretches lie submerged for hours or days, waiting in total stillness beneath the swamp’s surface. When prey passes, they erupt with surprising speed, dragging victims down into the muck for a slow and painful death. They possess only the most rudimentary intelligence, enough to stalk, to grasp, to kill.

Its body bears the scars of countless battles—scratched sigils, rusted chain-links, and broken weapons embedded in its frame. Despite its brutal bulk, it moves with frightening momentum, like a war machine barely restrained by flesh.\nDisposition: Gravethorns are bred, or forged, for war, often found serving as enforcers, warlords, or living battering rams in siege cults and martial clans. They care little for tactics beyond forward assault, and their fury is directed with singular focus toward whatever stands in their path. Once engaged, they rely on sheer force and unbreakable stamina to overwhelm foes, shrugging off blows that would fell lesser warriors.

The lion’s golden mane is scorched black at the tips, the goat’s soot-stained horns curve like jagged obsidian, and the dragon’s scaled muzzle smolders with inner fire, its whiskers crackling with sparks.

Its black, depthless eyes burn with an endless fury, and each hoofstep leaves scorched, blighted soil in its wake.\nDisposition: Berserk scavengers of corrupted valleys, Fellgrins consume everything—beast, carrion, or intruder. They charge with terrifying force, shattering terrain and crushing prey beneath tusks that radiate foul energy.

Fungal blooms sprout across its shoulders and back, releasing glittering spore clouds when it is struck. Its body shifts with unsettling silence, vines rustling faintly as if whispering in anticipation of violence.\nDisposition: Thorniss are fungal hives given form and malice, guardians of corrupted groves and vine-choked ruins.

Sparks cascade from its nostrils and claws, and its roar resounds like rolling thunder across valleys. When it soars, it appears to ride the storm itself, drawing clouds and lightning in its wake.\nDisposition: Proud, tempestuous, and fiercely territorial, the Thunderborn Drake rules storm-wracked peaks and coastal cliffs. It is not inherently cruel, but its aggression is swift and absolute when its domain is threatened. It strikes with the fury of a tempest, overwhelming foes in storms of lightning and thunder.

Massive tusks burn faintly with molten light, dripping slag from their edges. Its hunched, heat-cracked back radiates oppressive warmth, while its colossal forelimbs gouge trenches into the ground with every step. When it exhales, steam and molten spittle hiss from its maw, the earth shuddering beneath its tread.\nDisposition: Territorial brutes born of volcanic rifts, Grendraks demolish anything in their path. They charge at intruders with devastating fury, using their immense strength to collapse terrain and trap prey. Despite their savage form, they possess remarkable spatial awareness, never striking the same obstacle twice.

Its breath reeks like a midden pit turned inside out, swarming with flies that follow it as if to worship. Each massive footstep leaves a print that instantly fills with stagnant, brackish water.\nDisposition: A brute that thrives on fear and filth. The Hezrou charges headlong into the thickest cluster of foes just to stand in their midst, trusting its bulk, stink, and slime to break their courage. It pins enemies beneath its weight, tears shields from their hands, and revels when blades slip off its slick hide.

Rings of puckered scales mark old regrowths, proof of its regenerative terror. When enraged, its heads whip in unison, spraying blood, bile, and froth across the mire. Its stench is rot and wet scales, and its movements churn swamp water into whirlpools of death.\nDisposition: Tyrant of its domain, the Hydra thrashes at anything that spills its blood.

Its form constantly flickers, phasing between dimensions, leaving behind warping trails of bent gravity. Where a head should be, its chest gapes open with a jagged maw of swirling nothingness, devouring light and sound. Its scythe-like claws shine like shattered fragments of stars, and whispers of the void follow it, echoing from realities that should not be.\nDisposition: Nullmaws are instruments of unmaking, predators from beyond reality. They haunt places where the veil is thinnest—forgotten altars, dimensional scars, and dead stars. Not evil, but inevitable, they hunt powerful beings to consume essence itself.

Antler-like shards of frost crown its head, constantly reshaping in jagged, crystalline bursts. Its arms extend into icicle talons that freeze anything they touch, and its voice is a hollow wail, echoing like stormwinds through an endless canyon. Wherever it drifts, snow and frost cling unnaturally, layering terrain in sudden sheets of ice.\nDisposition: Manifesting within tundra blizzards and glacial storms, Rimecallers embody balance, enforcing stillness where chaos intrudes.

Pale, eyeless skin stretches taut over a skeletal frame, veins of black ichor pulsing visibly beneath the surface. Its vertical mouth brims with rows of writhing feelers, twitching constantly in eerie hunger. It moves with jerking spasms, its body vibrating at all times as if tuned to unseen frequencies.\nDisposition: Obsessive and fractured, the Skarnix is a relentless predator.

Its hide is thick with pale markings where old stingers shattered, testament to brutal survival. With a piercing shriek and venom-dripping fangs, it dominates the skies as a terror of cliffs, canyons, and battlefields.\nDisposition: Wyverns are sky bullies—aggressive, territorial, and pitiless.

Empty eye sockets burn with caged embers, and its parchment-thin wings spread with the creak of old tomes, releasing powdered dust like pages ground to ash. It carries itself with courtroom patience and butcher’s precision, cutting into battle with unnerving restraint and deliberate cruelty.\nDisposition: A surgical terror of the battlefield, the Bone Devil stalks high-value targets with methodical patience. It threads through ranks with its elongated claws, feints at range, and strikes with its venomous tail before retreating into the air. Its cruelty lies in grinding morale, snatching fallen prey from healers and piling their corpses like trophies.

Its heavy, broad features still show the thumbprints of its shaper, though its mouth is a mere horizontal slit, opening only to unleash booming bellows. Each lumbering step shakes the earth, and as its body cracks under stress, it erupts into furious bursts of strength until nothing around it stands intact.\nDisposition: A berserker servitor with no thought but obedience.

Hair braided with slag-wire and beads of molten stone smolders faintly, and every motion sheds sparks like a smith’s hammer. Its greatsword is a forge-length slab of burning steel that screams against stone when dragged, leaving trails of fire in its wake. The air reeks of soot and scorched metal, and every bootprint it leaves brands the ground in ash.\nDisposition: Masters of siege and discipline, Fire Giants advance in iron wedges, smashing fortifications and forcing defenders into the open where their reach and burning weapons dominate.

This section outlines essential practices and warnings to help GMs run successful, engaging sessions.\nNote for GMs: This section contains practical advice for running a smooth and fair game. Even experienced GMs are encouraged to read it, many of these tips come from real playtesting experience.\nGM Do’s\n\nPrepare Smart, Not Excessively: Focus on what matters, core plot beats, possible combat locations, and the motivations of key NPCs. You don’t need to know what’s behind every door unless it’s likely to be opened.\nSet Clear Expectations: Discuss tone, content limits, and game style during Session Zero. Make sure players understand the world’s logic, rules, and intended level of realism.\nSay Yes, Then Make It Cost: If a player proposes something creative but risky, allow it with conditions. Reward ingenuity without breaking stakes.\nBuild Consequences, Not Walls: Don’t block actions arbitrarily. Instead, ensure every major action has a believable outcome. Let actions matter.\nBe Consistent: If something is possible once, it should be possible again under similar circumstances. Inconsistency breaks immersion faster than anything else.\nUse the Rules as a Foundation: The Handbook is a framework, not a script. Interpret within reason but keep rulings fair and explainable.\nDescribe Like a Camera, Not a Script: Focus on what players would notice. Avoid monologues or internal dialogue unless tied to an ability. Keep perspective anchored.\nListen to Your Players: A good GM adjusts the world in subtle ways to reflect player goals, fears, and investment. The game is a collaboration.\n\nGM Don’ts\n\nDon’t Punish Curiosity: If players explore, investigate, or go off-route, reward it with worldbuilding or side content, not with traps or failure for “going off script.”\nDon’t Make It Personal: Never use GM power to retaliate or “win” against players. Your role is to challenge, not to dominate.\nDon’t Baby Your Players: Death is part of the game. Even new players should face real risk. Shielding them from failure or lethal consequences undermines the tension and meaning of their choices. Let them learn through danger, survival is earned, not granted.\nDon’t Withhold Basic Information: Keep mysteries, but don’t hide core mechanics, scene setups, or reasonable world logic. Clarity enhances agency.\nDon’t Let One Player Dominate: Make sure quiet players are heard, and spotlight time is fairly distributed. Everyone at the table matters.\nDon’t Change Rules Mid-Combat: If a mechanic needs adjusting, wait until after the encounter unless it’s an emergency fix agreed upon by all.\nDon’t Stall: If something’s uncertain (like a stat or effect), make a temporary ruling and keep play moving. You can finalize details after.\nDon’t Overplan Outcomes: Design situations, not conclusions. Let the story develop through play, not predetermined events.\nDon’t Run If You’re Burned Out: Tired GMs run flat sessions. It’s okay to pause, reschedule, or ask for support.\n\nNo plan survives contact with the players. You will design complex plots, elegant dungeon layouts, and dramatic monologues, only for the party to sell your ancient artifact to a traveling merchant or befriend the villain you spent weeks designing. This is not failure. This is the nature of tabletop roleplaying. The joy of the game lies in unpredictability, in collaboration, and in the chaotic beauty of shared storytelling. Your job is not to control the outcome, but to guide the momentum. You will never be fully prepared for what players decide to do, and that’s okay. Instead, build the skill of improv. Learn to pivot confidently, reframe missed content later, and say “yes, and” more often than “no, but.” The more you embrace uncertainty, the more alive your world will feel. Let go of perfection. Let the table surprise you.\nThe Rule Of Cool\nLet me tell you a quick story from one of our early test sessions. A player was running a Chelonar Monk, and during a boss fight against a massive dog, he declared he wanted to leap into the beast’s mouth, punch its throat from the inside, then retreat into his shell.\nThere were no specific rules for how to handle this kind of action, but I allowed it. I called for an Acrobatics check to see if he could pull it off. He succeeded, landed the hit, and I ruled that the strike bypassed the monster’s Vitality and dealt damage directly to its Health. Why? Because the move was so inventive, and in-character, that it deserved to have an impact. There was no realistic way for the monster to dodge while swallowing him.\nOf course, on the next round, he took massive damage for being inside a giant monster’s mouth, but that wasn’t the point. The point is this:\nWhen a player comes up with something exciting, cinematic, or wildly creative, even if it’s not strictly covered by the rules, consider letting it happen.\nThis is called the Rule of Cool. It’s not about ignoring the rules, but about bending them in favor of memorable moments and collaborative storytelling. Creativity should be rewarded, not stifled.\nJust remember: “Cool” doesn’t mean “free.” Risk, consequences, and the flow of logic still apply. But when a player goes big? Let them.\nStarting Levels/Equipment\nDon’t be afraid to start your players at level 1. Unlike some other systems (like 5e), level 1 in The World of Eyum still offers plenty of meaningful choices and gameplay options. While other games often feel slow or limited at early levels, leading groups to skip ahead to level 3 or 5, this system is designed to be engaging right from the beginning.\nLevel 0 represents non-adventuring NPCs such as commoners or untrained individuals. They use 1d4 for their Hit Dice, Vitality Dice, and Mana Dice.\nAvoid overloading players with powerful equipment at the start. Let them earn their strength and gear through play. If a piece of equipment fits the character’s background or narrative and isn’t unbalanced, it’s fine to allow it. But in general, avoid giving players overpowered starting items, you might be surprised how quickly characters grow strong on their own.\nBalancing Combat Difficulty\nOne of the most important skills for a GM in The World of Eyum is learning how to balance combat difficulty without relying on a rigid CR system. Eyum does not use fixed “challenge ratings” in the same way systems like 5e do, because power in this game scales rapidly and unevenly based on player choices, class synergies, and access to gear, spells, and subclass features. Two characters of the same level may vary wildly in combat effectiveness depending on their build, affinity spread, and access to key abilities. This means the GM cannot rely on level alone to determine what constitutes a “fair” or “deadly” encounter, and that’s okay. Instead, Eyum encourages you to balance encounters based on action economy, momentum dynamics, terrain advantage, and party condition.\nAction economy is the single most important factor in balancing an encounter. An enemy that can take more actions than the party, even if its stats are relatively modest, can overwhelm the group through sheer repetition of damage, effects, or mobility. Likewise, a party that can crowd-control a solo boss will trivialize it unless the boss has legendary actions or some means to break stun-locks. Generally, aim for parity or slight advantage in actions on the enemy side for tense fights, and give minibosses or named foes multi-phase action systems, summoned adds, or reactive powers that trigger outside of their turn. Avoid the mistake of equating high damage with high danger; many deadly enemies are so slow or rigid in action timing that they pose less threat than expected.\nMomentum is a less visible but critical factor: who controls the pace of the fight? Does the enemy force the players to reposition, adapt, or burn resources quickly? Momentum-based enemies don’t just deal damage, they shape the battlefield. For example, a creature that spreads terrain hazards each turn (like fire patches or necrotic zones) can force movement and disrupt formation, while illusionists may create decoys, suppress targeting, or break coordination. A well-balanced encounter includes some element of momentum tug-of-war: when the party has it, they feel powerful and in control. When they lose it, tension rises. Let momentum shift, not stagnate.\nTerrain is another essential lever. Small changes to the environment, elevated sniping positions, narrow chokepoints, cover zones, or interactable hazards, can drastically increase or decrease the challenge without altering enemy stats at all. In a game where player positioning, movement, and range matter, you should always consider terrain as part of the encounter design. Encourage creative use of the battlefield. A fight on an icy bridge should feel entirely different from one in a burning tavern or collapsed ruins. Use terrain to reward strategic thinking and to create meaningful variation in encounters, especially when using similar enemy types.\nParty condition should also be considered. Were they recently injured, low on mana, or out of healing? Did they enter the fight after a long rest with all cooldowns ready? These differences shift the effective difficulty dramatically. Don’t balance encounters assuming players are always at full strength. Instead, balance based on the narrative context: is this a boss fight they chose to engage while battered? Let that decision matter. But don’t spring surprise encounters after a resource-draining event unless you’re signaling the stakes clearly, it’s not about being easy, it’s about being fair.\nLastly, don’t forget the World of Eyum encourages the use of dynamic combat structures. Fights can evolve over time: reinforcements may arrive mid-battle, terrain may collapse or ignite, magical effects may change objectives. Allowing a combat to shift phases, such as an enemy transforming, the battlefield rotating, or a secret objective being revealed, makes even deadly fights feel manageable if the players adapt.\nCombat doesn’t need to be “perfectly balanced.” It needs to be engaging, meaningful, and survivable if played well. Err on the side of danger, but give your players the tools and information to succeed. And if you’re not sure how deadly something will be? Run the encounter in waves. Let the battlefield breathe. And always be ready to adjust, not by changing stats mid-fight, but by responding dynamically to player decisions and pacing. That’s the true art of Eyum encounter design.\nDesigning Meaningful Choices\nOne of the core responsibilities of a GM in The World of Eyum is creating situations where player choices matter. That does not mean giving players total freedom at all times, nor does it mean building binary “right or wrong” options. Instead, meaningful choices are those that shape the story, the world, or the party’s resources in tangible, lasting ways. Whether in combat, exploration, dialogue, or downtime, your job is to give players decisions that feel earned, impactful, and reflective of their character identities. Importantly, you must do this without railroading outcomes, guiding the world, but letting the players move through it under their own momentum.\nA meaningful choice is defined not by how dramatic it sounds, but by the real consequences it creates. Choosing whether to side with a faction should influence future allies, supplies, and quests. Deciding to leave a city in danger to pursue a personal goal should create fallout that lingers, distrust, economic collapse, or a refugee crisis. Even smaller-scale choices, like how to resolve a conflict between NPCs or how to approach a puzzle chamber, should ripple outward. If every choice leads to the same result, players will notice. If their decisions only matter cosmetically, they will stop engaging deeply with the story. The key is this: every choice should cost them something, whether that’s time, safety, reputation, or future opportunities.\nTo avoid railroading, never assume the players will follow a specific path. Instead, design scenarios, not scripts. Present dilemmas where each option is viable, but each comes with risk, tradeoffs, or moral ambiguity. For example, instead of forcing the players to fight a dungeon boss guarding a village, offer three routes: confront the boss, sabotage its reinforcements, or broker a dangerous deal with a rival threat. Don’t secretly steer them back to the same fight, let the story bend around the path they take. If they come up with an unexpected fourth option, follow the logic of the world and let it play out. You’re not there to trick them into picking “your” story, you’re there to help them build theirs.\nUse faction systems, reputation, and world memory to reinforce the weight of their choices. NPCs should remember when the players lied to them, failed to deliver on a promise, or saved their home. Factions should offer different types of rewards and assistance, and shouldn’t always get along. Let the players burn bridges if they want, but make sure they understand what’s at stake. Consequence isn’t punishment, it’s narrative accountability. The world is alive. It notices.\nAlso consider in-dungeon or moment-to-moment choices. Offer divergent objectives: retrieve the artifact or save the captives, but not both, because time is short. Or present enemies who beg for mercy, knowing the party needs the mana they’d get from finishing the fight. These moments don’t need long-term implications, but they give texture to the world and keep players engaged. Even choosing which door to open first should sometimes matter.\nMeaningful choices don’t need to be grand or game-altering, but they should always feel real. That means clear stakes, uncertain outcomes, and visible results. Avoid false choices, padded options, or illusions of control. Instead, let your world react, logically, consistently, and emotionally, to whatever the players do. You’ll be surprised how quickly your players stop “following the plot” and start living in the world.\nDealing With Death\nDeath in The World of Eyum carries real weight. Unlike systems where resurrection is commonplace, Eyum treats death as a serious, often permanent event. Resurrection is rare, as such, the way a GM handles death can significantly shape the tone of the campaign, the pacing of the story, and the trust between players and the world. A player dying should never feel cheap and it shouldn’t be meaningless. Your goal is to ensure death is earned, respected, and narratively satisfying, even when it’s tragic or unexpected.\nMechanically, character death occurs when a player is reduced to 0 health, or is outright killed by massive damage or a lethal effect. There are no “death saves” like in 5e. Once dead, a character stays dead unless one of the rare resurrection paths is used. This makes death a powerful narrative tool, not just a mechanical reset.\nAs a GM, don’t fear letting a character die, but don’t do it arbitrarily. Players will accept death when it comes from fair consequences, real choices, or moments of heroism. They won’t accept it when it feels random, unclear, or due to a misunderstanding. Communicate stakes clearly. If an enemy is about to deliver a potentially lethal attack, describe the danger. Give the player a moment to react, reposition, or make a desperate call. Let tension build, but once the moment resolves, honor it. Don’t pull back from a death that has been clearly telegraphed. Doing so cheapens the tension of future encounters and undermines the core risk of the world.\nNarratively, a death should resonate. If the character dies protecting an NPC, that NPC should remember it. If they fall during a failed infiltration, their absence should ripple through the faction network. Even a foolish or unlucky death can be treated with respect if it changes the world. Let the consequences live on. Consider funeral scenes, party grief, or dreams where the fallen character offers final words. These moments matter. Don’t force the party to move on too quickly.\nThat said, don’t treat death as a punishment. It’s not a “gotcha.” Instead, it’s a milestone, a hard turning point that says “this world is real, and it’s dangerous.” If a player dies early in a campaign and wants to make a new character, let them create a new character who enters the story in a connected way. Perhaps they were from the same village. Perhaps they were sent by a faction that heard of the original group. Keep the momentum going, but don’t erase what happened. Let death build the story, not reset it.\nUltimately, the best way to handle death in Eyum is to treat it like any other major shift in the story: with gravity, clarity, and meaning. If you respect the death, the players will too, even if it hurts.\nWhen to Say No\nAs the GM, your role is not just to narrate the world, it’s to protect its balance, tone, and integrity. The World of Eyum offers players immense creative freedom through its class design, spell system, affinity structure, and narrative flexibility. But with that freedom comes the risk of imbalance, disruption, or theme-breaking behavior. Part of being a responsible GM is knowing when, and how, to say “no.” Not out of control, but out of care. Your “no” isn’t an act of authority; it’s a safeguard for the shared story.\nStart by recognizing that not every request is made in bad faith. Players may suggest homebrew gear, new mechanics, or narrative actions that sound reasonable in isolation. But Eyum is finely tuned, its combat systems, class identities, item economy, and progression paths are interconnected. Something as simple as allowing a player to start with a powerful item, bypass crafting limitations, or stack passive bonuses can break that balance in ways that only become obvious five sessions later. The system was built to challenge players, not coddle them. Let them earn power. Let them struggle a little. That’s where Eyum shines.\nBe especially cautious about any suggestion that:\n\nBypasses the resource economy (e.g., infinite healing, free spellcasting, auto-succeed abilities)\nIntroduces passive scaling without cost (e.g., permanent buffs, duplicate class features, multi-affinity loopholes)\nBreaks tone or genre consistency (e.g., out-of-setting tech, unearned divine favor, disruptive comedy)\nUndermines choice-based systems (e.g., picking all subclass features, ignoring racial affinity rules)\n\nIn these cases, you must be willing to say “no”, not as a rejection of creativity, but as a preservation of structure. That said, how you say no matters. Always offer a reason: “This would break the crafting economy,” or “This would let you bypass an entire class’s core mechanic.” If possible, suggest an alternative that respects the same intent: “Instead of starting with that artifact, maybe you can earn it from the Vault of Glass two towns over.”\nSaying no also applies to story decisions. If a player tries to bypass roleplay with a single roll, or push a morally incoherent path just to derail the narrative, push back. Characters can be selfish, chaotic, or even violent, but they must still exist within a world that reacts and remembers. The GM’s job is not to “let anything happen”, it’s to make sure that what happens feels earned, consistent, and in tone. Eyum is not a comedy simulator or a power fantasy generator (unless you want it to be). It’s a gritty, often dangerous world where consequences matter. Let players push boundaries, but be prepared to push back.\nYou’re also allowed to say no to yourself. Sometimes a villain plan, trap, or surprise encounter will turn out too punishing, too confusing, or too out of sync with what’s working at the table. Pause, adjust, and reset expectations. You’re not locked into any script. The goal is challenge, not cruelty.\nIn the end, saying no should never be personal, arbitrary, or spiteful. It should be principled, clear, and constructive. A well-placed “no” protects the game’s structure, maintains fairness, and encourages players to think within the rules, not around them.\nRewarding Exploration\nExploration is one of the three foundational pillars of tabletop play, but it is often the most overlooked. In The World of Eyum, exploration is not just a matter of wandering from town to town. It’s how players uncover lost magic, forge faction ties, reveal secret history, and earn power that can’t be bought or brute-forced. Combat may earn them XP. Dialogue may shift allegiances. But exploration changes the world itself. As the GM, your job is to make exploration rewarding, deliberate, and full of potential.\nFirst and foremost, exploration should never feel like a filler activity. If players go off the beaten path, check the corners of a ruined structure, or seek out lore buried in forgotten vaults, the game should respond. That doesn’t mean handing out treasure for every successful Search check. It means creating a world that has depth beneath the surface, and players who look beneath that surface should find something. Hidden spells. Ancient alliances. Personal story hooks. Enemy weaknesses. Strange NPCs. Dangerous rumors. You don’t need to overprepare, just ensure the world rewards curiosity.\nUse factions and influence systems to give exploration weight. Perhaps a hidden shrine grants favor with a forgotten god. Perhaps helping an old traveler leads to access to a secret marketplace or restricted spell archive. Let players earn not just gold or gear, but relationships, trust, and reputation, assets that matter long-term. These don’t need mechanical bonuses. Social capital and narrative leverage are often more satisfying than loot.\nEyum’s material and crafting systems also create natural incentives for exploration. Rare ingredients like Echostone or Voidsand may not show up in shops, they exist in dangerous places, remote regions, or guarded by unusual creatures. If your players know that upgrading their equipment or crafting bombs depends on gathering rare materials, they will want to explore. Your job is to place those resources where they make narrative and biome sense, and to make reaching them feel like a mini-adventure.\nDon’t underestimate the power of environmental storytelling. A ruined city where all the clocks are stopped. A forest that speaks a forgotten dialect. A scorched battlefield with no corpses. These are mysteries that demand investigation. And when players investigate, reward them, not just with gold or a magic item, but with context. Maybe they learn who caused the destruction. Maybe they discover a weakness in a faction’s structure. Maybe they simply feel like they understand the world better. That’s a reward in itself.\nYou can also make exploration mechanically valuable. Spells or subclass features may key off knowledge, materials, or ritual locations. Certain classes (like Alchemists or Runemasters) thrive when players seek out unique reagents or symbols. Encourage them to think like researchers and wanderers, not just battlers.\nFinally, build in discovery loops. A ruined map leads to a tomb. A tomb leads to an artifact. The artifact alters a faction’s interest. That faction offers a mission, which leads to another site. When exploration becomes cyclical, when every mystery opens a new door, players become invested. They’ll start planning expeditions between missions. They’ll care about world geography. That’s when you know exploration is working.\nMake your world explorable not because it’s big, but because it’s alive. Hide secrets worth uncovering. Leave threads hanging. Let curiosity be the key that opens more of the game than combat ever could.\nManaging Party Power Disparity\nIn The World of Eyum, it is entirely possible, sometimes inevitable, for certain players to outpace others in raw combat effectiveness. This isn’t a flaw in the system; it’s a consequence of Eyum’s deep customization, open multiclassing, and power curves. A well-built Barbarian might survive a dragon’s breath. A careless Alchemist might die to a bandit ambush. One player may exploit terrain, affinity synergy, or unique items to devastating effect, while another struggles to land a meaningful hit. As the GM, your job is not to enforce artificial equality, but to manage the impact of disparity so that everyone feels useful, engaged, and important.\nFirst, understand that power imbalance is only a problem if it disrupts fun or narrative clarity. If the party has a “combat star” but the other players shine in social, exploration, or utility scenes, no intervention is needed. If the disparity is felt, but not resented, it may even add texture to the group dynamic. But if one player is invalidating encounters, overshadowing teammates, or dictating outcomes, then you have to address it, not by nerfing them, but by elevating others and diversifying the challenge.\nOne of the most effective tools is targeted encounter design. Build scenarios that test different strengths. A Fighter may dominate against a brute, but falter against enemies who teleport, fly, or resist physical damage. A fragile caster may feel weak in brawls but shine in a room full of lemmings. When combat doesn’t always reward the same tactics, everyone gets a chance to lead. Rotate enemy types, environments, and mission objectives. Not every problem should be solved with raw DPS.\nAlso consider asymmetric spotlighting. Give the high-power player challenges that don’t just measure strength, moral dilemmas, faction conflicts, or personal narrative threads. Let the rest of the party navigate traps, solve puzzles, or broker deals that the strong character can’t brute-force. If everyone gets a scene where they are the expert, you reduce the impact of statistical dominance.\nAvoid solving imbalance by punishing the strong player. Don’t throw enemies that only target them, steal their items, or negate their class features. That quickly feels personal and undermines their agency. Instead, reward the other players in ways that matter: exclusive information, narrative influence, rare crafting materials, or access to lore the strong character missed because they always fight first. Give quiet power, not obvious buffs.\nIn some cases, especially when a disparity becomes disruptive or unfun, a conversation is the best solution. Talk to the powerful player privately. They may be happy to dial back or shift tactics. Or they may be unaware that their build is overshadowing others. Most players want everyone to have fun, if you frame it as “Let’s make sure everyone gets a moment,” they’ll likely cooperate.\nFinally, remember that Eyum is a game of momentum and adaptation. A character who feels weak now may become a powerhouse at level 10. A hyper-optimized level 3 build may stagnate later. Disparity is fluid. Focus not on fixing it entirely, but on making sure it doesn’t become the only thing that defines the party dynamic.\nEveryone should feel like their presence matters. Power alone isn’t the problem, priority imbalance is. Keep the spotlight moving, challenge players in different ways, and build encounters that reward more than just numbers on a sheet.\nSession Zero Essentials\nBefore any campaign in The World of Eyum begins, it is critical to hold a Session Zero, a dedicated pre-game meeting where expectations, tone, boundaries, and mechanics are clarified between the GM and players. Because Eyum offers a highly customizable, open-ended system with lethal combat, modular class design, and a wide range of roleplay tones, a proper Session Zero isn’t optional, it’s foundational. Many campaign problems, including misaligned expectations, power imbalance, or narrative dissonance, can be avoided simply by having this conversation in advance.\nStart with the tone and theme of the campaign. Is this a grim survivalist saga through a collapsing empire? A hero’s journey across divine ruins? A political thriller between rival factions? The tone informs player choices, if they build a goofy character in a grim world, or a pacifist in a war-torn frontier, they may struggle to engage. Be clear about the kind of story you’re aiming to tell and what themes will be explored. Likewise, ask players what they want, whether it’s combat challenges, exploration, moral dilemmas, or character-driven arcs. Look for overlap. You’re not dictating tone, you’re aligning the table around a shared experience.\nNext, establish the level range and power curve. Will the party start at level 1 with basic equipment and a humble background? Or are they seasoned veterans entering at level 5 with subclass features? Let players know how fast they will level, whether you’re using milestone or XP progression, and how deadly the game is expected to be. This helps them calibrate their builds, especially important in Eyum, where certain classes scale faster than others.\nThen cover homebrew and rule modifications. Will you allow custom subclasses? Third-party material? New mechanics? What about alternate character creation rules (e.g., bonus affinities, background items, racial tweaks)? Make sure everyone understands what’s allowed and what isn’t, especially around multiclassing or unique gear. You don’t need to permit anything you’re not comfortable with. The Handbook encourages player creativity, but it also assumes GMs will enforce consistency and fairness.\nYou should also define the PvP and conflict policy. Is intra-party combat allowed? Are betrayal arcs on the table? Some groups enjoy high-drama tension between PCs. Others want total cooperation. Make sure everyone agrees on the limits before that first dagger hits a teammate’s back. You can still allow conflict, but everyone must know it’s a possibility and how it will be handled.\nDiscuss table safety, boundaries, and pacing. If you’ll be exploring heavy themes like torture, grief, or cult rituals, say so up front. Give players a chance to opt out or signal content they’d rather avoid. Likewise, decide how long sessions will last, how frequently you’ll play, and what happens when a player can’t attend. Consistency helps everyone stay invested.\nFinally, go over character integration. Ask players how their characters know each other, or give them a reason to form a team if they don’t. Encourage shared backstory elements: overlapping goals, linked hometowns, mutual enemies. The more connected they are, the easier it is to jump into the game with momentum. Players should not show up to Session One as strangers with no narrative glue unless that’s part of the campaign design.\nIn summary: a good Session Zero sets the foundation for everything that follows. It prevents confusion, discourages bad-faith behavior, and empowers everyone to invest deeply in the story. Don’t skip it. Don’t rush it. It’s your chance to build trust, define the rules of engagement, and turn a collection of sheets into a real adventuring party.\nUnderstanding Player Motivation and Creating Engaging Content\nA good GM doesn’t just run the game, they run the table. That means understanding what each player wants out of the experience and designing the world, encounters, and tone to support those needs without compromising the story. Not every player is excited by the same things. Some live for combat mastery, others crave character development, problem-solving, exploration, or social tension. Knowing how to engage different types of players is one of the most important skills you can learn as a Game Master.\n1. Identify What Each Player Enjoys\nThe first step is to observe your players. Listen to what excites them at the table. Do they light up when planning combat tactics? Do they monologue in character or constantly talk to NPCs? Do they explore the map, chase secrets, or try to “break” puzzles? Their behavior will tell you what they want.\nYou can also just ask, ideally during Session Zero. Ask questions like:\n\n“What kind of scenes do you hope to see?”\n“Do you prefer roleplay, combat, or problem-solving?”\n“Is there anything that instantly makes a session more fun for you?”\n\nUse this information to guide your prep. You don’t need to tailor every session to every player, but every player should have regular moments where the game speaks directly to their preferences.\n2. Types of Players and How to Engage Them\nBelow are common player archetypes you may encounter, and how to create content that keeps them engaged:\n\nThe Combat Strategist\nWhat they want: Tough fights, tactical decisions, team synergy\nHow to engage: Design encounters with interesting terrain, smart enemies, and shifting objectives. Reward good positioning, coordination, and creative use of abilities.\nThe Storyteller\nWhat they want: Character arcs, personal stakes, emotional scenes\nHow to engage: Tie the plot into their backstory. Introduce NPCs they care about. Let their decisions ripple outward. Give them hard choices with real consequences.\nThe Explorer\nWhat they want: Discovery, lore, secrets, strange locations\nHow to engage: Add hidden paths, ancient ruins, and lore-filled journals. Let them uncover new knowledge that reshapes how the party understands the world.\nThe Problem Solver\nWhat they want: Puzzles, tricky enemies, resource challenges\nHow to engage: Include riddles, traps, social logic puzzles, and multi-step goals. Let them feel clever for cracking your design.\nThe Power Gamer\nWhat they want: Growth, strong builds, rare loot\nHow to engage: Reward smart play with powerful gear or character development. Let them experiment with builds, but keep encounters challenging enough to matter.\nThe Roleplayer\nWhat they want: Dialogue, character immersion, social tension\nHow to engage: Fill the world with distinct NPCs. Let them change minds, gain influence, or get into complex conversations. Allow meaningful downtime scenes.\nThe Chaos Agent\nWhat they want: Freedom, unpredictability, comedy\nHow to engage: Give them room to try odd things, and let consequences play out naturally. Avoid railroading. Let their chaos affect the world, but keep the tone balanced.\n\nMost players fall into more than one category. The key is to rotate focus so that every few sessions, each player type gets something that feels made for them.\n3. Balance Player Focus and Spotlight Time\nGood GMing isn’t just about offering different types of scenes, it’s about sharing them fairly. Track who has had recent major moments. Is someone dominating the spotlight? Has someone been quiet for a while? Draw the quieter players in with scenes that match their playstyle. If one player got a major arc last session, maybe this time you highlight another character’s subplot or interest.\nLet players shine in different ways. One session might feature a roleplay-heavy negotiation. The next, a brutal combat gauntlet. Then, a mystery dungeon or a wilderness survival challenge. Each format brings different players to the front.\n4. Encourage Collaboration, Not Competition\nWhile it’s good to engage individual preferences, don’t pit them against each other. Encourage players to support one another’s moments. The strategist can protect the storyteller. The explorer can uncover ruins that the lore-seeker explains. Build your world so that different player types depend on each other to succeed.\n5. Be Flexible and Listen\nWhat excites players may change over time. Someone who joined for combat may become more interested in their character’s arc. A new player might find they love exploration. Pay attention. Ask questions after sessions. If something falls flat, adjust. Your job isn’t to guess perfectly, it’s to listen and respond."},"Chapter-9---Appendices/9.3-Player's-Guide":{"slug":"Chapter-9---Appendices/9.3-Player's-Guide","filePath":"Chapter 9 - Appendices/9.3 Player's Guide.md","title":"9.3 Player's Guide","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This guide is general information and advice that all Players should know and understand. \nHow to Build a Thematic Character\nA good character is more than just a collection of stats and combat abilities. In The World of Eyum, creating a compelling and memorable character means building someone whose story, mechanics, and personality are woven together from the very beginning. This doesn’t just improve roleplay, it strengthens the entire campaign, gives your GM more to work with, and helps you stay invested in your journey.\nStart with your character’s past. Who were they before the game began? What mattered to them? Were they a tradesperson, a soldier, a runaway, or something stranger? What did they lose, or leave behind, to end up where they are now? You don’t need a five-page essay, but you do need a clear emotional foundation. This is what makes the character real. Think about one or two defining memories: a betrayal, a discovery, a promise, or a tragedy. These moments can shape everything from class selection to how the character reacts to danger or trust.\nFrom there, think about their goals. What do they want now? Why do they adventure? It might be survival, redemption, knowledge, power, or vengeance. Whatever it is, it should be something that motivates them across sessions. Characters who have no desire or drive tend to feel disconnected from the world. Give your character something personal to pursue, even if it’s just the hope of finding a place to belong.\nWhen choosing your race, don’t just look at the mechanical bonuses. Each race in Eyum comes with its own history, worldview, and cultural texture. A Ferramite isn’t just tough, they were shaped by hardship and labor. A Lumari isn’t just mystical, they’re tied to illusion, secrecy, and ancient bloodlines. Choosing a race should mean choosing a lens through which your character sees the world. If you want to play against type, that’s fine, but acknowledge it in your backstory. A kind-hearted pacifist Gorul makes for a great twist, but it should be intentional, not accidental.\nOnce your background is clear, tie it into your class and subclass. Why did your character become what they are? Did a Sorcerer’s magic awaken violently during a crisis? Did a Bard begin playing to escape their past or win over a hostile court? Did your Fighter learn to fight in the arena, or while defending their home from raiders? Class choice should emerge naturally from your character’s life, not just be a mechanical decision. Subclass choice, too, should reflect something about who they are becoming, what they’ve committed to, what they’ve accepted, or what they’ve learned.\nAdd detail by defining a few clear personality traits, flaws, and habits. Are they reckless? Overconfident? Compassionate but naive? Do they struggle with trust, anger, or guilt? Pick flaws that matter, ones that could affect group decisions or complicate their goals. Eyum is a world where emotional weight carries forward, and your character should be someone who grows, not just someone who levels up. You don’t need to write these all down, but you as the player do need to know them.\nYou should also name a few people in your character’s life, friends, family, mentors, rivals, or even enemies. These associates don’t have to be central to the plot, but they make the world feel lived in. Give your GM some names and connections they can bring into the story. It adds weight to your character’s choices when they’re not fighting for “the world,” but for someone specific.\nFinally, don’t forget that your character exists in a world with factions, cultures, and history. Where are they from? What region shaped them? Do they belong to any group, cause, or belief system? Did they break from tradition, or are they carrying on a legacy? Use your backstory to define your relationship to the world, and to give your GM tools to make your character feel like a natural part of it.\nA thematic character is one whose class, race, background, and personality are all pulling in the same direction. They don’t have to be optimized, they have to make sense. And when they do, you’ll find that your choices in combat, exploration, and story moments feel more natural, more rewarding, and more personal. That’s the kind of character people remember. That’s the kind of character who belongs in Eyum.\nHow to Contribute in Combat (Even If You’re Not the Strongest)\nCombat in The World of Eyum is dangerous, tactical, and often unforgiving. Some characters will deal massive damage, soak up hits, or dominate the battlefield from the start. But raw damage is not the only way to be valuable in combat. No matter your class or build, you have tools to shift the tide of a fight, if you understand your role, play to your strengths, and act with purpose.\nThe first thing to understand is that combat isn’t just about numbers. It’s about momentum and control. You can influence a battle by protecting your allies, disrupting the enemy’s plans, managing space, or forcing difficult choices. You don’t need to be the one dealing the final blow, you need to be the one making that blow possible.\nEvery character has a role in combat, whether they’re built for it or not. Traditional roles include:\n\nTank - Draws aggro, soaks damage, and holds choke points. Often the frontline.\nDPS - Focuses on raw damage, ideally eliminating high-priority threats quickly.\nSupport - Buffs allies, heals wounds, and keeps the team in fighting condition.\nController - Uses spells or positioning to limit enemy movement or abilities.\nTactician - Makes smart use of items, positioning, terrain, and mechanics to create opportunities for others.\n\nYou don’t need to fit cleanly into one of these roles, but you should know where your strengths lie. A Rogue who can’t frontline still contributes massively by eliminating weak targets. A Bard may never kill an enemy, but a well-placed debuff or Bardic Inspiration can turn a guaranteed loss into a win.\nPositioning is one of the most underrated ways to contribute. Block a hallway to prevent reinforcements. Flank an enemy to give allies better hit chances. Move to protect a squishier caster from getting jumped. These decisions matter far more than one extra point of damage.\nItems are another major factor. Eyum’s combat system rewards creative item use, bombs, potions, improvised gear, and environmental tools can shift the balance of a fight. If you’re not hitting hard, make yourself useful by pulling out a smoke bomb, disarming a trap mid-combat, or tossing a healing potion to an ally. Never be afraid to use your gear, it’s there for a reason.\nCommunication also sets good players apart. Ask your teammates what they need. Declare your intent clearly. If you’re planning to shove an enemy into a trap or delay an attack to let the Cleric heal, let the others know. Eyum isn’t just about mechanics, it’s about teamwork. Coordinated parties win. Disconnected ones fall apart.\nRemember that survivability is its own contribution. Going down early in the fight because you tried to “prove” your damage isn’t helping anyone. Sometimes, the smartest move is to guard a healer, retreat from danger, or spend a turn regrouping. Staying on your feet means more turns to help your team.\nIf you’re feeling underpowered, don’t disengage, adapt. Talk to your GM between sessions about what your character is good at and where they want to grow. Sometimes the best thing you can do is double down on a unique strength. You don’t have to be the best at everything. You just have to matter.\nIn Eyum, survival is a group effort. If you can create space, protect your allies, outthink the enemy, or change the battlefield, even without big damage, you’re doing your job. Your role is never irrelevant. Lean into it.\nMaking Smart Choices at Low Levels\nLow-level play in The World of Eyum is not a tutorial. It is dangerous, dynamic, and often lethal. You are not a hero yet, you are a survivor, a student, or a soldier at the start of a long and brutal path. While higher levels unlock flashy spells and powerful subclass features, levels 1 through 3 are about learning how to survive with limited resources, making deliberate decisions, and setting the tone for your character’s future. If you treat low-level play like filler, you’re going to get someone killed, maybe yourself.\nThe first rule of low-level survival is simple: don’t overextend. Your health is low, your mana is limited, and your gear is likely weak or improvised. This is not the time to charge into five enemies alone or burn your last mana points on a minor spell. Pace yourself. Hold something in reserve. Know when to push and when to retreat. Combat in Eyum doesn’t scale for fairness, it scales based on logic. If you walk into a den of bandits thinking the GM will “go easy because you’re level 1,” you’ll be a corpse before round three.\nKnow what your character is good at, and what they’re not. If you’re a fragile caster, stay back and play smart. If you’re a martial character, don’t just swing, control space, body block, and protect your allies. Smart players at low levels play together, not as individuals. Always be aware of positioning, enemy numbers, and escape routes. Even just moving to cover or holding an action can make a massive difference. You don’t need to win every fight, you just need to live through it.\nInvest in useful gear early. Healing items, basic bombs, traps, or defensive tools can be more valuable than a stat bonus. Don’t hoard your items, they’re meant to be used. If you’re not sure what to buy or scavenge, ask your GM or look for ways your background could justify starting equipment. Crafting systems and tools become more relevant as you level, but at low levels, smart item usage can be a lifesaver.\nPay attention to your party’s composition and synergy. If no one can heal, don’t just hope you’ll be fine. If everyone picked glass cannon builds, someone needs to take on a tanking or utility role, even temporarily. Party balance matters most when resources are scarce and combat is fast. You’re not just playing your sheet, you’re playing your team.\nAlso, look for opportunities to earn small advantages outside of combat. Ask questions, use your background skills, explore carefully, and try to gather information before committing to a fight. Low-level groups that scout, plan, and avoid bad terrain win more encounters than ones that blindly engage. Creative solutions are rewarded in Eyum. Don’t be afraid to play dirty, bargain with enemies, or exploit the environment. Low-level success often comes from outsmarting, not overpowering.\nFinally, take the time to define your character’s path. What do they want to become? What subclass or power goal are they working toward? What weaknesses are they trying to overcome? Even if you don’t have the resources to specialize yet, you should be planting the seeds now. A character who wants to be a holy warrior may start by protecting others and learning to endure. A future necromancer might begin collecting bones or researching obscure rituals. Eyum rewards commitment to identity, even before your stats catch up.\nLow-level play in Eyum is not about surviving until the “real game” begins. It is the real game. It teaches you how to think, how to act under pressure, and how to grow. If you treat it with respect, your character will not only survive, it will feel earned.\nHow to Roleplay Without Slowing the Game\nRoleplaying is one of the most rewarding parts of The World of Eyum, but it’s also one of the easiest places for the game’s pace to break down. When done well, roleplay deepens immersion, strengthens character bonds, and brings the world to life. When done poorly, it can grind a session to a halt, alienate other players, or cause confusion. The goal is not to act perfectly or give dramatic speeches, it’s to play a believable character in a way that keeps the game moving forward.\nStart by understanding your role in the party’s story. You don’t need to be a spotlight-stealing performer. In fact, Eyum tends to reward collaborative, grounded roleplay more than theatrical monologues. Know who your character is, how they speak, and what they care about, and then show that through action and choice. You can roleplay with a sentence, a gesture, or even a silence. Not every moment needs to be a scene.\nThe most important principle is timing. Don’t interrupt fast-paced scenes (like combat or urgent decision points) with long backstory reveals or personal drama. Save deeper conversations for downtime, travel, or quiet moments. If you’re not sure whether it’s the right time to speak up, ask the group or GM out of character. A simple “Can we do a quick roleplay scene?” goes a long way toward keeping the flow respectful.\nTry to share the spotlight. If you’ve had a long character moment, step back and invite others into the scene. If another player’s arc is front and center, support them rather than redirecting the focus. Good roleplayers don’t just act, they listen, respond, and elevate others. Some of the best scenes come not from planned speeches, but from genuine character-to-character dialogue where everyone gets to contribute.\nUse roleplay to reinforce, not replace, your mechanics. If you’re intimidating an enemy, roll for it. If you’re making a clever argument, back it up with your Charisma. Don’t use acting as a way to bypass the system, Eyum is designed for mechanics and narrative to support each other. Let your stats inform how you roleplay success or failure. A low-Charisma character might ramble awkwardly even if the player is articulate. A high-Wisdom character might see through deception without needing to say a word.\nKeep your character consistent but flexible. You should know how they react to pressure, to authority, to temptation, but leave room for growth. Eyum’s story will challenge your character’s values. Let them change over time. A stubborn mercenary might learn to care. A zealot might start to doubt. You don’t need to plan your arc, but you should be open to it evolving. That’s where the best roleplay lives, not in perfection, but in adaptation.\nLastly, remember that roleplaying is a group activity. You’re not here to perform at the table, you’re here to build something with the table. Check in with other players if you’re unsure whether your character’s behavior is disruptive or entertaining. Some tables love conflict between characters; others find it draining. Respect those boundaries. The best roleplay happens when everyone feels safe, heard, and engaged.\nIn Eyum, roleplay isn’t a separate mode, it’s woven into the system. Use it to shape your choices, strengthen your identity, and explore your flaws. Just keep one eye on the story and the other on your party. If you do that, your character will come to life, and the game will keep moving.\nWhat to Do On (and Off) Your Turn\nIn The World of Eyum, the game doesn’t stop when it’s not your turn. Whether you’re in combat, exploration, or a roleplay scene, every player shares responsibility for keeping the session focused, moving, and meaningful. While the rules give each player a turn in initiative or dialogue, the game world is constantly shifting, and the way you engage between turns can have as much impact as what you do during them.\nOn your turn, your job is to act clearly, decisively, and with intent. This doesn’t mean rushing, but it does mean being ready. Know your abilities, keep track of your health and resources, and think ahead while others are going. When your name is called, take the spotlight seriously. Ask yourself: What does my character want to do right now? How can I support the party? Is this the right time to push, reposition, defend, or improvise?\nBut just as importantly, off your turn, your job is to stay present. That means putting your phone away, keeping one ear on the action, and being ready to respond. Too often, players mentally check out when it’s not “their turn,” but Eyum is a game of constant motion. You might be called on for a reaction, a saving throw, or a tactical choice in the middle of someone else’s move. If you’re distracted, the moment passes, and the party suffers.\nDuring roleplay scenes, pay attention even if you’re not speaking. Watch how other characters act. Take notes on what NPCs say. Ask yourself: How would my character feel about this? Would they approve, intervene, or stay silent? Even if you’re quiet, you’re still playing. And when you do speak, respect pacing, don’t interrupt or derail scenes just to insert yourself. Wait for a natural opening, or ask the GM to cut to you when the timing fits.\nThe spotlight should shift throughout the session. If it’s been on you for a while, during a duel, a social confrontation, or a long backstory reveal, be conscious of it. Finish your moment, then pass it on. Let someone else shine. Similarly, if another player is having a key moment, support it. Stay in character, react visibly, and offer short, meaningful contributions that enhance the scene instead of dragging it sideways.\nIn combat, you can stay engaged by tracking initiative order, planning your next move, watching for combo setups, or preparing a reaction. Know what your character can do even when it’s not their turn. Can you intercept an enemy? Shield an ally? Shout a warning? If you don’t know, ask. Eyum rewards coordination, and the best players know how to act with the group, not just beside them.\nAvoid passive disengagement. Don’t use “it’s not my turn” as a reason to zone out. Don’t wait to be told what’s happening. Be part of the scene, whether it’s combat, dialogue, or downtime. Help manage initiative, call out rules when needed, or keep track of party resources. The more engaged you are between turns, the smoother and more enjoyable the game becomes, for everyone.\nBeing a good player isn’t just about what you do on your turn. It’s about how you play the whole session. Stay sharp. Pay attention. Respect the spotlight. And always look for ways to lift the scene, whether it’s yours or not.\nUsing Items, Gear, and Crafting\nIn The World of Eyum, items and gear aren’t just stat bonuses, they’re survival tools, power enhancers, and storytelling devices. Whether it’s a hand-welded axe, a salvaged potion, or a rare alchemical component, what you carry shapes how you play. Players who pay attention to their gear are often the ones who survive longer, hit harder, and solve problems the others don’t even see.\nFirst, understand that items are not decorations. They are often your most flexible and reliable resource. Weapons define your range, damage type, and style. Armor can be the difference between surviving an ambush and bleeding out on the floor. Tools let you bypass obstacles, disable traps, or create improvised solutions. Even mundane items, rope, oil, a mirror, chalk, can solve critical problems with a little creativity.\nDon’t wait for the perfect moment to use your gear. Use it now. If you’re holding onto a bomb, throw it. If you’ve got a potion, drink it. Eyum is not a game that rewards hoarding (generally), it rewards smart, tactical use of your inventory. If you never use your tools because you’re “saving them for later,” chances are good you’ll never use them at all.\nPay close attention to item properties. Some weapons are heavier but ignore some armor. Some are faster, easier to hide, or deal specific damage types. You might want to carry a backup weapon for different enemy types. Likewise, bombs, poisons, and special ammunition can dramatically change your effectiveness in the right fight. If you’re not sure what an item does, ask the GM or experiment. Most items aren’t limited by class, anyone can carry and use a tool if they understand it.\nWhen it comes to crafting, Eyum opens even more possibilities. Characters can collect materials from dungeons, monsters, or the environment and use them to forge weapons, mix potions, create bombs, or upgrade existing gear. This system encourages exploration, rare items aren’t bought, they’re found. If you want to be powerful, don’t just look for gold, look for components. Ask yourself: What can I build that no one else has? What unique item could define my character?\nIf you’re playing a class that interacts directly with crafting, like an Alchemist or a Runemaster, you should be tracking your materials constantly. Plan recipes, keep your pack organized, and think about what kind of gear you want to make next. If you’re not a crafting-heavy class, you should still engage with the system. Even a single well-timed crafted item can swing a fight, or save your life.\nYou can also personalize your gear. Describe it, name it, connect it to your character’s story. Did you make that sword yourself? Is that talisman a gift from a mentor? Did you scavenge that armor from a ruined temple? Eyum thrives on immersion, and when your equipment is part of your narrative identity, not just a stat block, it becomes something you care about.\nFinally, talk to your GM about opportunities to trade, steal, barter, or earn items through the world. Markets, faction vendors, or secret caches can give you access to gear no one else has. Look beyond the character sheet and into the world around you. If you want something, go after it.\nIn Eyum, items are not just a side system, they are a core part of your power and your playstyle. Keep your inventory active. Use what you carry. Build what you need. And make sure that every item you bring feels like it belongs to you.\nSurviving Dangerous Encounters\nCombat in The World of Eyum is not designed to be fair. It’s designed to be deadly, reactive, and meaningful. Many enemies can kill a careless player in a single round. Some fights can’t be won through brute force. The difference between survival and a quick death often comes down to what you do before the first blow is struck, and how well you adapt once the fight begins.\nThe first step to survival is understanding the risk. If you’re walking into a crypt crawling with necrotic energy or dealing with a beast that locals whisper about, assume it’s dangerous. Don’t charge blindly. Ask questions. Scout. Plan. Use your background or known associates to gather intel. Just because the GM has placed a fight in front of you doesn’t mean you’re expected to win it right now. You can retreat. You can return later. Survival is a choice.\nWhen combat does start, positioning is everything. Stay close to allies who can support you, avoid exposing your back or sides to multiple enemies, and don’t isolate yourself unless you’re built to tank. If you’re ranged, keep to cover and avoid tight spaces. If you’re melee, control chokepoints and protect weaker allies. Use the environment, tables, doorways, ledges, furniture. Treat every battlefield like a puzzle, not a flat map.\nFocus fire matters. A party that splits its attacks across too many enemies will get overwhelmed. Identify key threats, casters, leaders, glass-cannon monsters, and take them down first. Talk to your party. Coordinate. If you don’t work together, you will die separately.\nDon’t save everything for later. Use your bombs, your potions, your traps, and your biggest spells when the situation calls for it. This system doesn’t reward hoarding, it rewards timely use. It’s better to end the fight fast than to stretch it out hoping to conserve resources while your health slips away.\nPay attention to the momentum of the fight. Who has control? If the enemies are forcing you to move, draining your mana, or boxing you in, you’re losing. Look for ways to shift momentum: disrupt their formation, change the terrain, or hit their support units. Survival isn’t always about out-damaging, it’s about destabilizing the enemy.\nKnow when to retreat. This is not a game where every encounter is scaled to your power level. If the fight is going badly, someone is down, you’re boxed in, the enemy hasn’t even used its major abilities yet, call a retreat. Throw smoke, use a distraction, or disengage. Smart escapes are part of what makes Eyum feel real. Live to fight again.\nPlay to your strengths. If you’re a healer, keep people up, not just at 1 HP, but stable and able to act. If you’re a controller, block movement, slow reinforcements, or deny key areas. If you’re a tank, don’t chase stragglers, hold the line. Know your role and lean into it.\nFinally, don’t panic when things go wrong. They will. People will fall. Surprises will happen. That’s Eyum. Think clearly. Look for creative options. Could you throw an enemy off a ledge? Pull a lever? Talk your way out mid-combat? Can you delay just long enough for reinforcements? Panic kills more characters than enemies ever will.\nSurvival in Eyum is not about having the best stats. It’s about staying alert, acting with intention, and knowing your limits. Play smart. Fight together. And if things go sideways, remember: the world doesn’t care that you’re the main character, only whether you make it out alive.\nMulticlassing Without Ruining Your Build\nThe World of Eyum is designed with multiclassing in mind. It’s not just allowed, it’s encouraged. Unlike some systems where multiclassing can easily break your character or leave you behind, Eyum treats class levels as modular tools. Each class gives you something unique at level 1, and many continue to offer strong, specialized features as you progress. Smart multiclassing lets you shape your character’s growth, adapt to new challenges, and carve out a playstyle that’s entirely your own.\nThat said, multiclassing isn’t just about grabbing flavor, it’s about making meaningful choices. You should only multiclass into a class if you actually plan to use what it gives you. If you don’t want to cast spells, don’t take levels in Wizard. If you’re never going to brew or throw bombs, don’t take Alchemist. Picking up a class just because it “sounds cool” or offers a minor passive bonus will almost always lead to dead weight on your sheet.\nThink about what a new class actually adds to your gameplay. Will you gain access to a damage type or ability you didn’t have before? Does it fill a gap, like healing, mobility, or defense? Does it match your character’s story arc or tactical needs? If the answer is yes, it’s probably a great pick. But if you’re only grabbing it for a single mechanic you might never use, you’re probably better off investing deeper in what you already do well.\nMulticlassing works best when you commit to using the features you gain. If you take a level in Cleric, you should be healing or supporting . If you dip into Rogue, you should be using positioning, sneak attacks, or mobility to change how you fight. The more you integrate those new tools into your actual combat behavior and character identity, the more powerful and cohesive your build becomes.\nYou don’t have to fully “finish” a class before branching out. Many classes in Eyum front-load powerful abilities at level 1 or 2, making them attractive for tactical multiclassing. But always look ahead. Ask yourself: If I take this level now, what am I giving up later? Could I delay a powerful subclass feature or upgrade? Some classes unlock key features at level 3 or 5. Be aware of your timing.\nAlso, remember that subclass identity matters. If you multiclass into a new class, you’re also committing to a second subclass. Don’t treat it like a throwaway, subclasses often define the role and tone of your character. They’re not just mechanical, they’re narrative. Picking a subclass just to farm one passive bonus usually results in a character with unclear focus or overlapping features that don’t sync.\nFinally, multiclassing is a chance to reflect your character’s evolution. Did they undergo a major trauma, and now they’re developing magical potential? Did they leave behind their temple and become a blade for hire? Use multiclassing to show that growth. Your character’s story and mechanics should evolve together, not in conflict.\nMulticlassing in Eyum is generally a good choice. It lets you round out your weaknesses, specialize into hybrid roles, and access combinations no single class can offer. Just remember: don’t take what you won’t use. Multiclassing should expand your gameplay, not clutter your character sheet. Be deliberate. Be committed. And build something worth playing.\nRespecting the Table\nNo matter how compelling your character is, how clever your tactics are, or how deep your backstory runs, none of it matters if you’re a bad tablemate. The World of Eyum is a game about survival, collaboration, and storytelling. That means every player at the table matters just as much as you do. Respecting the game means respecting the people playing it with you.\nThe first and most important rule: this is a group story, not a solo campaign. That means everyone deserves time to shine, to speak, and to shape the story. If you’re dominating every conversation, interrupting scenes, or hijacking every combat plan, you’re not playing a better character, you’re just playing alone in a shared space. Step back when the spotlight isn’t yours. Let other players have their moments. Support their decisions, even if they’re not the ones you’d make.\nDuring roleplay, listen as much as you speak. Don’t jump in every time an NPC finishes a sentence. Let quieter players contribute. Some of the best roleplay scenes aren’t about fast-talking or dramatic monologues, they’re about authentic character interaction. If another character is going through something big, don’t undercut it with a joke or tangent. Be present. Be generous.\nIn combat, communicate clearly and don’t delay your turn. Stay engaged even when it’s not your moment to act. Don’t check out or start side conversations while others are playing. The faster and more focused everyone is, the more time you all get to spend immersed in the world, not waiting for someone to notice it’s their turn in initiative.\nIf a disagreement comes up, about rules, outcomes, or decisions, handle it maturely. You can question a ruling, but do it respectfully. Don’t argue for five minutes about one ability. Trust that your GM is trying to be fair, and if something truly feels wrong, bring it up after the session. In-game disputes should be settled in character. Out-of-game friction should be handled calmly, with clarity and compassion.\nDon’t metagame. Your character doesn’t know enemy stats, plot twists, or what the GM is foreshadowing. Don’t use player knowledge to manipulate outcomes or steal agency. Let your character make mistakes. Let the world surprise you.\nAlso: be mindful of tone. Eyum supports dark, heavy themes, but your table might not. If you want to play a violent or morally complex character, check with your group. If you enjoy character conflict, make sure everyone’s on board. Consent and trust are non-negotiable. Everyone should feel safe and respected, even when characters argue or struggle.\nLastly, come prepared. Know your abilities, bring your materials, and take notes when needed. Show up on time. Be present. The more seriously you treat the game, the more seriously everyone else will too.\nRespecting the table isn’t about rules, it’s about responsibility. You are one piece of a shared world, and the better you play with others, the better everyone’s story becomes."},"Chapter-9---Appendices/9.4-Sample-Adventures-(WIP)":{"slug":"Chapter-9---Appendices/9.4-Sample-Adventures-(WIP)","filePath":"Chapter 9 - Appendices/9.4 Sample Adventures (WIP).md","title":"9.4 Sample Adventures (WIP)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Nothing here right now…"},"README":{"slug":"README","filePath":"README.md","title":"README","links":["Chapter-2---Core-Rules/2.1-Basic-Mechanics/2.1-Basic-Mechanics","Chapter-3---Character-Creation/3.1-Step-by-Step-Character-Creation/3.1-Step-by-Step-Character-Creation"],"tags":[],"content":"Eyum-TTRPG\nThe World of Eyum is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) inspired by Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e, rebuilt for long-term scalability and a consistent, integrated magic system. At its core, it’s a collaborative storytelling game: players control unique characters while a Narrator or Game Master (GM) presents the world, portrays its inhabitants, and adjudicates outcomes. The goal isn’t to “win” but to tell memorable stories together, whether in a single-session one-shot or a long campaign where your characters rise from humble beginnings to world-shaping heroes.\nThis repository is part of an ongoing project to turn the Eyum Handbook into a wiki-style reference. Right now, the content is written for and in Obsidian, but we are gradually adding links, navigation, and formatting so that it functions as a full wiki you can browse and use online.
